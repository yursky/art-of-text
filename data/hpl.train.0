his little old servant parks, who for years bore patiently with his vagaries, last saw him on the morning he drove off alone in his car with a key he had recently found .
he had read of it with interest, for the paper had told about some strange burrows or passages found in the rocky hill beneath .
i had been assured that the old man could do nothing but hint at wild, disjointed, and incredible legends, and i had been warned that the natives made it unsafe to be seen talking to him; yet the thought of this aged witness to the town 's decay, with memories going back to the early days of ships and factories, was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist .

it being still daylight, i descended to the square and looked around for a dinner of some sort; noticing as i did so the strange glances i received from the unwholesome loafers .
the youth 's febrile mind, apparently, was dwelling on strange things; and the doctor shuddered now and then as he spoke of them .
he was a small, lean, bent person, with shabby clothes, blue eyes, grotesque, satyr like face, and nearly bald head; and at my first words seemed both angered and frightened .
the youth said that he was very restless, seldom sitting around the station for more than an hour or two at a time .

three of the emma 's men, including capt .
it had not left behind quite all that it had attacked, for sometimes it had been hungry .
for that very fresh body, at last writhing into full and terrifying consciousness with eyes dilated at the memory of its last scene on earth, threw out its frantic hands in a life and death struggle with the air; and suddenly collapsing into a second and final dissolution from which there could be no return, screamed out the cry that will ring eternally in my aching brain:  ''help keep off, you cursed little tow head fiend keep that damned needle away from me '' v .

that gilman talked in his sleep was plain, and it was obviously from desrochers ' keyhole listenings that the delusive notion of the violet dream light had got abroad .
clearly, my nerves were sorely taxed, and i must cast off these impressions of weaker men .
the old man saw it, and stopped whispering even before my expression of horror made it necessary; saw it and glanced quickly toward the floor of the room he had left an hour before .

at last the french element had appeared that, and another deeper element of horror which the name conjured up from the darkest recesses of my weird and heterogeneous reading and i feverishly studied the platting of the locality as it had been before the cutting through and partial straightening of back street between and  .

as i surveyed this quaint apartment, i felt an increase in that aversion first excited by the bleak exterior of the house .
in babson street, which crossed federal and might thus reveal me to the searchers, i clung as closely as possible to the sagging, uneven buildings; twice pausing in a doorway as the noises behind me momentarily increased .
what annoyed me was merely the persistent way in which the volume tended to fall open of itself at plate xii, which represented in gruesome detail a butcher 's shop of the cannibal anziques .

there was only one person in sight an elderly man without what i had come to call the  ''innsmouth look '' and i decided not to ask him any of the questions which bothered me; remembering that odd things had been noticed in this hotel .
