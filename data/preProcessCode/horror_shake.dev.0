herbert west needed fresh bodies because his life work was the reanimation of the dead .
the farm like grounds extended back very deeply up the hill, almost to wheaton street .
his facial aspect, too, was remarkable for its maturity; for though he shared his mother  's and grandfather's chinlessness, his firm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression of his large, dark, almost latin eyes to give him an air of quasi adulthood and well nigh preternatural intelligence .

dr  . johnson, as i beheld him, was a full, pursy man, very ill drest, and of slovenly aspect.
i have indistinct recollections of a great storm some time after i reached the boat; at any rate, i know that i heard peals of thunder and other tones which nature utters only in her wildest moods .
there had seemed to be no one in the courtyard below, and i hoped there would be a chance to get away before the spreading of a general alarm .
nothing, however, occurred except some hill noises; and when the day came there were many who hoped that the new horror had gone as swiftly as it had come .
it was getting dark, and the ancient roofs and chimney pots outside looked very queer through the bull 's eye window panes .
again he seemed to be in the interior of a house an old house, apparently but the details and inhabitants were constantly changing, and he could never be certain of the faces or the furniture, or even of the room itself, since doors and windows seemed in just as great a state of flux as the more presumably mobile objects .
 ''and what about the window panes? ''  ''they were all gone .

ahead lay sparse grass and scrub blueberry bushes, and beyond them the naked rock of the crag and the thin peak of the dreaded grey cottage .
everyone seemed inclined to be silent now, as though holding a secret fear .

as i have said, it happened when we were in the medical school, where west had already made himself notorious through his wild theories on the nature of death and the possibility of overcoming it artificially .
a definite point among the stars had a claim on him and was calling him .

then the lean nith remarked that no one had seen the old man or his wife since the night the cats were away .
and as i looked, i beheld the head rise, the black, liquid, and deep sunken eyes open in terror, and the thin, shadowed lips part as if for a scream too frightful to be uttered .

his engagement broken, galpin moved east to begin life anew; but before long, appletonians heard of his dismissal in disgrace from new york university, where he had obtained an instructorship in english .
he had a narrow head, bulging, watery blue eyes that seemed never to wink, a flat nose, a receding forehead and chin, and singularly undeveloped ears .
only a very rare affliction, of course, could bring about such vast and radical anatomical changes in a single individual after maturity changes involving osseous factors as basic as the shape of the skull but then, even this aspect was no more baffling and unheard of than the visible features of the malady as a whole .

it was my last link with a chapter of life forever closed, and i valued it highly .
to me there was nothing grotesque in the bones and skeletons that strowed some of the stone crypts deep down among the foundations .
the thing cannot be described there is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order .
it was queer damnably queer and my uncle spoke almost sheepishly, as if half expecting not to be believed, when he declared that of the strange faces many had unmistakably borne the features of the harris family .
not any more does he long for the magic of farther hills, or sigh for secrets that peer like green reefs from a bottomless sea .
then, as i remained, paralysed with fear, he found his voice and in his dying breath screamed forth those words which have ever afterward haunted my days and my nights .
they never stopped swimmin            ' in an' aout o' the river from that cursed reef o' satan an' more an' more attic winders got a boarded up, an' more an' more noises was heerd in haouses as wa'n't s'posed to hev nobody in 'em    . . . .
at lawrence he had been prominent in the mock fraternity of  ''tappa tappa keg '', where he was the wildest and merriest of the wild and merry young roysterers; but this immature, collegiate frivolity did not satisfy him .

there were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to connecting rooms, and these i proceeded to fasten .
the professor had been stricken whilst returning from the newport boat; falling suddenly, as witnesses said, after having been jostled by a nautical looking negro who had come from one of the queer dark courts on the precipitous hillside which formed a short cut from the waterfront to the deceased 's home in williams street .
suddenly the wretch, animated with his last burst of strength, raised his hideous head from the damp and sunken pavement .

sheehan   's is the acknowledged centre to chicago's subterranean traffic in liquor and narcotics, and as such has a certain dignity which extends even to the unkempt attachés of the place; but there was until lately one who lay outside the pale of that dignity one who shared the squalor and filth, but not the importance, of sheehan's .

no recognised school of sculpture had animated this terrible object, yet centuries and even thousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish surface of unplaceable stone .
all in all, he became a disconcerting and even gruesome companion; yet in my gratitude for his healing i could not well abandon him to the strangers around him, and was careful to dust his room and attend to his needs each day, muffled in a heavy ulster which i bought especially for the purpose .
it was a lambent glow of this sort which always played about the old woman and the small furry thing in those lighter, sharper dreams which prefaced his plunge into unknown abysses, and the thought that a wakeful second person could see the dream luminance was utterly beyond sane harbourage .

when i heard the fears which had driven the people from kilderry i laughed as loudly as my friend had laughed, for these fears were of the vaguest, wildest, and most absurd character .
i had been, albeit without definite reason, instinctively on my guard and that was to my advantage in the new and real crisis, whatever it might turn out to be .
then with utter and horrifying suddenness we heard a frightful sound from below .

that scene itself must have corresponded to the sealed loft overhead, which had begun to attack his imagination so violently, but later impressions were faint and hazy .
it was plain that the owner had come home; but he had not come from the land, nor from any balloon or airship that could be imagined .
others thought and still think he 'd found an old pirate cache out on devil reef .
this is what i saw in the glass: a thin, dark man of medium stature attired in the clerical garb of the anglican church, apparently about thirty, and with rimless, steel bowed glasses glistening beneath a sallow, olive forehead of abnormal height .

as my uncle began slowly and grudgingly to unwrap the things he urged me not to be shocked by the strangeness and frequent hideousness of the designs .
as i looked, a subtle, curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion; and oddly enough, i found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression .
it is curious that although he differed so widely from the mass of hispanicised and tribal indians, romero gave not the least impression of caucasian blood .
the task seemed interminable, and i raged almost as violently as the hermit when i saw the hours slipping by in a breathless, foodless round of vain telephoning, and a hectic quest from place to place, hither and thither by subway and surface car .
who or what then, was my great great grandmother?
nor was any child to be born alive in that house for a century and a half .
then, as september approached, the clouds began to clear .
at times her screams became insupportable, and for long periods she would utter shrieking horrors which necessitated her son 's temporary residence with his cousin, peleg harris, in presbyterian lane near the new college building .
it was the pictorial carving, however, that did most to hold me spellbound .
the grave was not very deep, but fully as good as that of the previous specimen the thing which had risen of itself and uttered a sound .
the abysses were by no means vacant, being crowded with indescribably angled masses of alien hued substance, some of which appeared to be organic while others seemed inorganic .
past the churchyard, where there were no houses, i could see over the hill 's summit and watch the glimmer of stars on the harbour, though the town was invisible in the dark .
the tension on our part became very great .
you on earth have unwittingly felt its distant presence you who without knowing idly gave to its blinking beacon the name of algol, the daemon star .
again a furtive trying of a bolted connecting door, and again a receding creaking .
i was still alone, for as much as i feared the unknown horror i sought, there was more fear in the thought of telling anybody .

briden looked back and went mad, laughing shrilly as he kept on laughing at intervals till death found him one night in the cabin whilst johansen was wandering deliriously .
to this man iranon spoke, as to so many others:  ''canst thou tell me where i may find aira, the city of marble and beryl, where flows the hyaline nithra and where the falls of the tiny kra sing to verdant valleys and hills forested with yath trees? ''
in my childhood the shunned house was vacant, with barren, gnarled, and terrible old trees, long, queerly pale grass, and nightmarishly misshapen weeds in the high terraced yard where birds never lingered .
there were reasons why i would have been glad to let the war separate us; reasons why i found the practice of medicine and the companionship of west more and more irritating; but when he had gone to ottawa and through a colleague 's influence secured a medical commission as major, i could not resist the imperious persuasion of one determined that i should accompany him in my usual capacity .
geographically it lay about two miles northwest of the base of tempest mountain, and three miles from the oak girt mansion .

on his throat were the marks of murderous hands, and on his left ankle was a distressing rat bite .
thus was i left to ponder on myself as the only human creature within the great fortress, and in my utter solitude my mind began to cease its vain protest against the impending doom, to become almost reconciled to the fate which so many of my ancestors had met .
but even in this acute moment my chief horror was something apart from the immediate weakness of my defences .
trade fallin      ' off, mills losin' business even the new ones an' the best of our menfolks kilt a privateerin' in the war of or lost with the elizy brig an' the ranger snow both of 'em gilman venters .

and one, who led the way, was clad in a ghoulishly humped black coat and striped trousers, and had a man 's felt hat perched on the shapeless thing that answered for a head    . . . .
the event, under the circumstances, was tremendous; for in the existence of a subterranean space here, my mad theories had terrible confirmation .
gilman 's dreams consisted largely in plunges through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and bafflingly disordered sound; abysses whose material and gravitational properties, and whose relation to his own entity, he could not even begin to explain .
the insane yarn i had heard from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams, and i felt i must keep the image of his wild, watery eyes as far as possible from my imagination .
there was none of the exotic technique you see in sidney sime, none of the trans saturnian landscapes and lunar fungi that clark ashton smith uses to freeze the blood .

an   ' the smell was awful, like what it is araound wizard whateley's ol' haouse   . . .
on a certain rainy afternoon when this illusion seemed phenomenally strong, and when, in addition, i had fancied i glimpsed a kind of thin, yellowish, shimmering exhalation rising from the nitrous pattern toward the yawning fireplace, i spoke to my uncle about the matter .
accordingly i kept north along main to martin, then turning inland, crossing federal street safely north of the green, and entering the decayed patrician neighbourhood of northern broad, washington, lafayette, and adams streets .
in bolton the prevailing spirit of puritanism had outlawed the sport of boxing with the usual result .
yet where had the fellow got such an odd notion?
at night he would not be alone, nor would the company of a few persons calm him .
its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing, and it soon came to be the greatest influence on the town, replacing freemasonry altogether and taking up headquarters in the old masonic hall on new church green .
we both inserted the whole unopened wooden box, closed the door, and started the electricity .
his dreams were meanwhile increasing in vividness, and though shewing him none of the strange cities and incredible gardens of the old days, were assuming a definite cast whose purpose could not be mistaken .
now, as the baying of that dead, fleshless monstrosity grows louder and louder, and the stealthy whirring and flapping of those accursed web wings circles closer and closer, i shall seek with my revolver the oblivion which is my only refuge from the unnamed and unnamable .
dr  . west 's reanimated specimens were not meant for long existence or a large audience.
the old woman always appeared out of thin air near the corner where the downward slant met the inward slant .
but it was not in these vortices of complete alienage that he saw brown jenkin .
the open book lay flat between us, with the picture staring repulsively upward .
i motioned to him to continue, which he did with renewed signs of reluctance .
he was merely crass of fibre and function thoughtless, careless, and liquorish, as his easily avoidable accident proves, and without that modicum of imagination which holds the average citizen within certain limits fixed by taste .
what this meant, no one could quite be certain till later .
i was also sorry that i had no one with whom to converse .
what i saw unnerved me most surprisingly, considering its relative triviality .
i had entered the brush grown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odour again waxed dominant .
after that experience west had dropped his researches for some time; but as the zeal of the born scientist slowly returned, he again became importunate with the college faculty, pleading for the use of the dissecting room and of fresh human specimens for the work he regarded as so overwhelmingly important .
evidently the ticket agent had not exaggerated the dislike which local people bore toward innsmouth and its denizens .
then came the frenzied tones again:   ''carter, it's terrible monstrous unbelievable '' this time my voice did not fail me, and i poured into the transmitter a flood of excited questions .
and yet, as the members severally shook their heads and confessed defeat at the inspector 's problem, there was one man in that gathering who suspected a touch of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and writing, and who presently told with some diffidence of the odd trifle he knew .
and it was under a horned waning moon that i saw the city for the first time .
perhaps it is madness that is overtaking me yet perhaps a greater horror or a greater marvel is reaching out .
here, truly, was the apotheosis of the unnamable .
those who have watched the tall, lean, terrible old man in these peculiar conversations, do not watch him again .
west, young despite his marvellous scientific acquirements, had scant patience with good dr  . halsey and his erudite colleagues; and nursed an increasing resentment, coupled with a desire to prove his theories to these obtuse worthies in some striking and dramatic fashion.
some time before noon his physician, dr  . hartwell, called to see him and insisted that he cease work.
gilman could not be very clear about his reasons for this last assumption, but his haziness here was more than overbalanced by his clearness on other complex points .
the aspect of that ruin i cannot describe i must have been mad, for it seemed to rise majestic and undecayed, splendid and column cinctured, the flame reflecting marble of its entablature piercing the sky like the apex of a temple on a mountain top .
his own face was in shadow, and he wore a wide brimmed hat which somehow blended perfectly with the out of date cloak he affected; but i was subtly disquieted even before he addressed me .
it was an odd scene, and because i was strange to new england i had never known its like before .
it was a key a guide to certain gateways and transitions of which mystics have dreamed and whispered since the race was young, and which lead to freedoms and discoveries beyond the three dimensions and realms of life and matter that we know .
as the hour for its arrival drew near i noticed a general drift of the loungers to other places up the street, or to the ideal lunch across the square .
it seems to me rather merciful that i do not, for they were terrible studies, which i pursued more through reluctant fascination than through actual inclination .
all made o  ' squirmin' ropes    . . .
looking about, i saw that the ceiling was wet and dripping; the soaking apparently proceeding from a corner on the side toward the street .
one afternoon there was a discussion of possible freakish curvatures in space, and of theoretical points of approach or even contact between our part of the cosmos and various other regions as distant as the farthest stars or the trans galactic gulfs themselves or even as fabulously remote as the tentatively conceivable cosmic units beyond the whole einsteinian space time continuum .
certainly it sounds absurd to hear that a woman educated only in the rudiments of french often shouted for hours in a coarse and idiomatic form of that language, or that the same person, alone and guarded, complained wildly of a staring thing which bit and chewed at her .
men have felt the tears of the gods on white capped thurai, though they have thought it rain; and have heard the sighs of the gods in the plaintive dawn winds of lerion .
besides, the body would not be even approximately fresh the next night .
gilman mechanically attended classes that morning, but was wholly unable to fix his mind on his studies .

a paralysis of fear stifled all attempts to cry out .
then one night when the moon was full the travellers came to a mountain crest and looked down upon the myriad lights of oonai .
we expelled the bodies through the double hatches and were alone in the u  .
when, to agree with him, i said i was distrustful of the authenticity of ossian 's ms, mr  . johnson said:  ''that, sir, does not do your understanding particular credit; for what all the town is sensible of, is no great discovery for a grub street critick to make.
back bay isn   't boston it isn't anything yet, because it's had no time to pick up memories and attract local spirits .
especially was he afraid to be out of doors alone when the stars were shining, and if forced to this condition he would often glance furtively at the sky as if hunted by some monstrous thing therein .
as the afternoon advanced, it became increasingly difficult to see; and we heard the rumble of a thunderstorm gathering over tempest mountain .
my preference would be to avoid paine, since the fire station there might be open all night .
chords, vibrations, and harmonic ecstasies echoed passionately on every hand; while on my ravished sight burst the stupendous spectacle of ultimate beauty .
and the roof is of pure gold, set upon tall pillars of ruby and azure, and having such carven figures of gods and heroes that he who looks up to those heights seems to gaze upon the living olympus .
the place was avoided with doubled assiduousness, and invested with every whispered myth tradition could supply .
it seems that on that last hideous night joe had stooped to look at the crimson rat tracks which led from gilman 's couch to the nearby hole .
for without warning, in one of the small hours beyond midnight, all the ravages of the years and the storms and the worms came to a tremendous climax; and after the crash there was nothing left standing in the street save two ancient chimneys and part of a stout brick wall .
it was, the belgian averred, a most extraordinary object; an object quite beyond the power of a layman to classify .
i did not like the way he looked at healthy living bodies; and then there came a nightmarish session in the cellar laboratory when i learned that a certain specimen had been a living body when he secured it .
i said it at first and i say it still, and i never swerved an inch, either, when he shewed that  ''ghoul feeding '' .
whilst they strove to strip from life its embroidered robes of myth, and to shew in naked ugliness the foul thing that is reality, kuranes sought for beauty alone .
unwholesome recollections of things in the necronomicon and the black book welled up, and he found himself swaying to infandous rhythms said to pertain to the blackest ceremonies of the sabbat and to have an origin outside the time and space we comprehend .
all denied a part in the ritual murders, and averred that the killing had been done by black winged ones which had come to them from their immemorial meeting place in the haunted wood .
they were that kind the old lattice windows that went out of use before  .
the bones of the tiny paws, it is rumoured, imply prehensile characteristics more typical of a diminutive monkey than of a rat; while the small skull with its savage yellow fangs is of the utmost anomalousness, appearing from certain angles like a miniature, monstrously degraded parody of a human skull .
morbid art doesn 't shock me, and when a man has the genius pickman had i feel it an honour to know him, no matter what direction his work takes .
from those blurred and fragmentary memories we may infer much, yet prove little .
of my exact age, even down to days and hours, i kept a most careful record, for each movement of the pendulum of the massive clock in the library told off so much more of my doomed existence .
at first it told to me only the plain little tales of calm beaches and near ports, but with the years it grew more friendly and spoke of other things; of things more strange and more distant in space and in time .
now, he reflected, those nervous fears were being mirrored in his disordered dreams .
open up the gates to yog sothoth with the long chant that ye  'll find on page of the complete edition, an' then put a match to the prison .

my host now took my hand to draw me to one of the two windows on the long side of the malodorous room, and at the first touch of his ungloved fingers i turned cold .

yog sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate .
when exceptions did occur, they were mostly persons with no trace of aberrancy, like the old clerk at the hotel .

it was he who had given me all the information i had of tillinghast after i was repulsed in rage .
when gilman climbed up a ladder to the cobwebbed level loft above the rest of the attic he found vestiges of a bygone aperture tightly and heavily covered with ancient planking and secured by the stout wooden pegs common in colonial carpentry .
many were the waterfalls in their courses, and many were the lilied lakelets into which they expanded .
nor could i ever after see the world as i had known it .
in the deeper dreams everything was likewise more distinct, and gilman felt that the twilight abysses around him were those of the fourth dimension .
they talked of their illustrious tyrant, and of the splendour of his capital; and exulted in the glory of the statue which musides had wrought for him .

i neither knew nor cared whether my experience was insanity, dreaming, or magic; but was determined to gaze on brilliance and gaiety at any cost .
i stopped automatically, though lacking the brain to retreat .
the scenery, judged by any ordinary aesthetic canon, is more than commonly beautiful; yet there is no influx of artists or summer tourists .
he was wholly alone, and his first act was to walk to the balustrade and look dizzily down at the endless, cyclopean city almost two thousand feet below .
those who had lacked something lacked it no longer, yet did fear and hatred and ignorance still brood over the street; for many had stayed behind, and many strangers had come from distant places to the ancient houses .
this i perceived with unhealthy sharpness despite the fact that two of my other senses were violently assailed .

as the weeks passed, the playing grew wilder, whilst the old musician acquired an increasing haggardness and furtiveness pitiful to behold .
in short, both principle and policy demanded stern action; and i could not doubt but that publius scribonius, bearing in mind the dignity and obligations of the roman people, would adhere to his plan of despatching the cohort, me accompanying, despite such objections as balbutius and asellius speaking indeed more like provincials than romans might see fit to offer and multiply .

not far from the grey city of ib did the wandering tribes lay the first stones of sarnath, and at the beings of ib they marvelled greatly .

whilst barzai was shouting these things atal felt a spectral change in the air, as if the laws of earth were bowing to greater laws; for though the way was steeper than ever, the upward path was now grown fearsomely easy, and the bulging cliff proved scarce an obstacle when he reached it and slid perilously up its convex face .

the things we saw were very old and marvellous, or at least they seemed so in the few straggling rays of light by which i viewed them, and i shall never forget the tottering ionic columns and fluted pilasters and urn headed iron fence posts and flaring lintelled windows and decorative fanlights that appeared to grow quainter and stranger the deeper we advanced into this inexhaustible maze of unknown antiquity .

we often cast a beam around the ship, but saw only dolphins, swimming parallel to our own drifting course .
and, as i have implied, it was not of the dead man himself that i became afraid .
warped and bigoted with preconceived illusions of justice, freedom, and consistency, they cast off the old lore and the old ways with the old beliefs; nor ever stopped to think that that lore and those ways were the sole makers of their present thoughts and judgments, and the sole guides and standards in a meaningless universe without fixed aims or stable points of reference .

i have said that i awaked suddenly and in alarm .
but when the moon went over to the west and the still tide ebbed from the sullen shore, i saw in that light old spires that the waves almost uncovered, and white columns gay with festoons of green seaweed .
the place was far from any road, and in sight of no other house, yet precautions were none the less necessary; since rumours of strange lights, started by chance nocturnal roamers, would soon bring disaster on our enterprise .
there was nothing like a ladder in the tomb, and the coffin niches on the sides and rear which birch seldom took the trouble to use afforded no ascent to the space above the door .

what i did succeed in doing was to overhear the nocturnal playing of the dumb old man .
about , when wilbur was a boy of ten whose mind, voice, stature, and bearded face gave all the impressions of maturity, a second great siege of carpentry went on at the old house .

it had been an eldritch thing no wonder sensitive students shudder at the puritan age in massachusetts .
he would have descended and asked the way to ooth nargai had not a fearsome aurora sputtered up from some remote place beyond the horizon, shewing the ruin and antiquity of the city, and the stagnation of the reedy river, and the death lying upon that land, as it had lain since king kynaratholis came home from his conquests to find the vengeance of the gods .
the press cuttings, as i have intimated, touched on cases of panic, mania, and eccentricity during the given period .
they glistened bloated and green in the moonbeams, and seemed to gaze up at the fount of light .
my immediate actions were peculiar for such a situation, but it is only in tales that a man does the dramatic and foreseen thing .
here the dense growth of weeds and briers hindered me and cruelly tore my clothes, but i was none the less glad that they were there to give me concealment in case of peril .
there was talk of a complaint to the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals; but nothing ever came of it, since dunwich folk are never anxious to call the outside world 's attention to themselves .
we chose our house with the greatest care, seizing at last on a rather run down cottage near the end of pond street; five numbers from the closest neighbour, and separated from the local potter 's field by only a stretch of meadow land, bisected by a narrow neck of the rather dense forest which lies to the north .
i now visited the accursed place with increased frequency; studying the unwholesome vegetation of the garden, examining all the walls of the building, and poring over every inch of the earthen cellar floor .

i believe i did ridiculous things such as offering prayers to artemis, latona, demeter, persephone, and plouton .
they insisted that this was kingsport, and i could not deny it .
the newcomer was a thin, dark man of medium height attired in the clerical garb of the anglican church .
the smell of the sea took on ominous implications, and the silent driver 's bent, rigid back and narrow head became more and more hateful .

william harris, at last thoroughly convinced of the radically unhealthful nature of his abode, now took steps toward quitting it and closing it forever .
it wearied carter to see how solemnly people tried to make earthly reality out of old myths which every step of their boasted science confuted, and this misplaced seriousness killed the attachment he might have kept for the ancient creeds had they been content to offer the sonorous rites and emotional outlets in their true guise of ethereal fantasy .
i cannot express the wild, breathless suspense with which we waited for results on this first really fresh specimen the first we could reasonably expect to open its lips in rational speech, perhaps to tell of what it had seen beyond the unfathomable abyss .
he sometimes dreamed better when awake, and he wanted to use that key .

i had, i felt, been halted by a barrier which my friend and leader had successfully passed .
after the beams came clouds, and then i slept .
the villagers of hatheg say it is ill to climb hatheg kla at any time, and deadly to climb it by night when pale vapours hide the summit and the moon; but barzai heeded them not when he came from neighbouring ulthar with the young priest atal, who was his disciple .
apparently the horror had descended by a route much the same as that of its ascent .
relieved of my seizure in a marvellously short while, i left the shivery place a disciple and devotee of the gifted recluse .
only an effort halted him at a cafeteria in church street, and after the meal he felt the unknown pull still more strongly .
for some unknown reason i dreaded the thought of disturbing the ancient bog and its sunless secrets, and pictured terrible sights lying black under the unmeasured depth of age old peat .
on account of the general alarm and precautions, there were only two more victims, and the capture was effected without major casualties .
it was in the dark of september th that the horror broke loose .
there were vague statements about disease and concentration camps, and later about dispersal in various naval and military prisons, but nothing positive ever developed .
on reflection, he was glad he had not consulted the still more inquisitive college doctor .
barzai knew so much of the gods that he could tell of their comings and goings, and guessed so many of their secrets that he was deemed half a god himself .
others   'll worship with us at meetin' time, an' sarten haouses hez got to entertain guests    . . .
we did not descend far, and when after several hours the sea was calmer, we decided to return to the surface .
he had thought he heard rats in the partitions all the evening, but paid little attention to them .
it appeared that i was a provincial quæstor named l   . cælius rufus, and that i had been summoned by the proconsul, p. scribonius libo, who had come from tarraco some days before.
i admired his clearness and persistence, and added some further revelations i had collected among the old people .
   ''let me see, trever, '' continued the defaulter,  ''didn't schultz say your mother is a literary person, too? ''  ''yes, damn it, '' replied trever,  ''but nothing like the old teian she's one of those dull, eternal moralisers that try to take all the joy out of life .
the terror which brought me to the scene was a sudden and portentous confirmation of the mountaineers ' wildest legends .
on the third day slater was found unconscious in the hollow of a tree, and taken to the nearest gaol; where alienists from albany examined him as soon as his senses returned .
somewhere, to what remote and fearsome region i know not, denys barry has gone .
my mind, as alert as my senses, recognised the gravely unusual; and almost automatically i leaped up and turned about to grasp the destructive instruments which we had left trained on the mouldy spot before the fireplace .
that the influence of the old house was unwholesome, he could not deny; but traces of his early morbid interest still held him there .
they say there is no land of lomar, save in my nocturnal imaginings; that in those realms where the pole star shines high and red aldebaran crawls low around the horizon, there has been naught save ice and snow for thousands of years, and never a man save squat yellow creatures, blighted by the cold, whom they call  ''esquimaux '' .
degraded and ignorant as they were, the creatures held with surprising consistency to the central idea of their loathsome faith .
of the name and abode of this man but little is written, for they were of the waking world only; yet it is said that both were obscure .
some said the thunder called the lurking fear out of its habitation, while others said the thunder was its voice .
i hear a noise at the door, as of some immense slippery body lumbering against it .
his oddities certainly did not look asiatic, polynesian, levantine, or negroid, yet i could see why the people found him alien .
as i hurried home through those narrow, winding, mist choked waterfront streets i had a frightful impression of being stealthily followed by softly padding feet .
that at least two of the fear 's embodiments were destroyed, formed but a slight guarantee of mental and physical safety in this acheron of multiform diabolism; yet i continued my quest with even greater zeal as events and revelations became more monstrous .
it was not a strong or even a fairly strong light; certainly not nearly strong enough to read an average book by .
only his tendency toward a dazed stupor prevented him from screaming aloud .
i am an entity like that which you yourself become in the freedom of dreamless sleep .
it was more horrible than anything i had ever overheard, because i could now see the expression of his face, and could realise that this time the motive was stark fear .
he had heard, meanwhile, of whateley 's grotesque trip to cambridge, and of his frantic efforts to borrow or copy from the necronomicon at the widener library .
early risers on the th noticed a peculiar stench in the air .
in the midst of these reflections, as if dramatically arranged to intensify them, there fell near by a terrific bolt of lightning followed by the sound of sliding earth .
i hated the mocking moon, the hypocritical plain, the festering mountain, and those sinister mounds .
reading the life of theseus, i was much impressed by that passage telling of the great stone beneath which the boyish hero was to find his tokens of destiny whenever he should become old enough to lift its enormous weight .
those old ones were gone now, inside the earth and under the sea; but their dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to the first men, who formed a cult which had never died .
and there were cobblestones over which clattered many a blooded horse and rumbled many a gilded coach; and brick sidewalks with horse blocks and hitching posts .
the more he remembered of his hideous dream the more terrified he felt, and it added to his desperation to hear joe mazurewicz chanting mournfully two floors below .
sometimes he would take walks through shadowy tangles of unpaved musty smelling lanes where eldritch brown houses of unknown age leaned and tottered and leered mockingly through narrow, small paned windows .
i did, however, improve my stay in arkham by collecting some genealogical notes i had long wished to possess; very rough and hasty data, it is true, but capable of good use later on when i might have time to collate and codify them .
messrs  . ricci, czanek, and silva selected the night of april th for their call.
the rue d 'auseil lay across a dark river bordered by precipitous brick blear windowed warehouses and spanned by a ponderous bridge of dark stone .
when i see this i telled eb holt,        'that's suthin' ta stir ye up an' make yer blood tickle' when i read in scripter about slayin' like them midianites was slew i kinder think things, but i ain't got no picter of it .
the really inexplicable thing was the way in which the victims ignorant people, for the ill smelling and widely shunned house could now be rented to no others would babble maledictions in french, a language they could not possibly have studied to any extent .
i remember the night i made the five concentric circles of fire on the floor, and stood in the innermost one chanting that monstrous litany the messenger from tartary had brought .
meanwhile joyful servants were proclaiming the finding of young godfrey in a distant and unused chamber of the great edifice, telling too late that poor michel had been killed in vain .
and yet i saw them in a limitless stream flopping, hopping, croaking, bleating surging inhumanly through the spectral moonlight in a grotesque, malignant saraband of fantastic nightmare .
north of the river there were traces of squalid life active fish packing houses in water street, smoking chimneys and patched roofs here and there, occasional sounds from indeterminate sources, and infrequent shambling forms in the dismal streets and unpaved lanes but i seemed to find this even more oppressive than the southerly desertion .
the picture was very vivid for a while, but gradually gave way to a more horrible conception; that of utter, absolute solitude in infinite, sightless, soundless space .
the next day, it appears, they raised and landed on a small island, although none is known to exist in that part of the ocean; and six of the men somehow died ashore, though johansen is queerly reticent about this part of his story, and speaks only of their falling into a rock chasm .
only old zebulon, who was not with the group, could have done justice to the situation or suggested a plausible explanation .
they filed a ponderous report at the court house in aylesbury, and litigations concerning heirship are said to be still in progress amongst the innumerable whateleys, decayed and undecayed, of the upper miskatonic valley .
it was from these that i determined to choose a colleague, and the more i reflected the more my preference inclined toward one arthur munroe, a dark, lean man of about thirty five, whose education, taste, intelligence, and temperament all seemed to mark him as one not bound to conventional ideas and experiences .
but of what followed, and of the reason i was found alone and dazed on the edge of the swamp next morning, i must insist that i know nothing save what i have told you over and over again .
he would often awake calling for his mother and grandfather, both in their graves a quarter of a century .
i told them of the vault, and they pointed to the unbroken plaster wall and laughed .
at three o 'clock he took some lunch at a restaurant, noting meanwhile that the pull had either lessened or divided itself .
the whippoorwills were piping wildly, and in a singularly curious irregular rhythm quite unlike that of the visible ritual .
this fusion of dream and reality was too much to bear .
in she fell victim to a mild form of insanity, and was thereafter confined to the upper part of the house; her elder maiden sister, mercy dexter, having moved in to take charge of the family .
he talked of death incessantly, but laughed hollowly when such things as burial or funeral arrangements were gently suggested .
the villagers did not know how much to believe from so small a boy; and though they feared that the evil pair had charmed the cats to their death, they preferred not to chide the old cotter till they met him outside his dark and repellent yard .
it is still spectral, but its strangeness fascinates me, and i shall find mixed with my relief a queer regret when it is torn down to make way for a tawdry shop or vulgar apartment building .
reason, logic, and normal ideas of motivation stood confounded .
for three days they climbed higher, higher, and higher toward the roof of the world; then they camped to wait for the clouding of the moon .
aunt martha was in the doorway, and did not scold too hard when benijah shoved the truant in .
probably they traded in arkham, knowing how little kingsport liked their habitation, or perhaps being unable to climb down the cliff on the kingsport side .
rome and ravenna are rivals for the honour of his birth, though it is certain that he received his rhetorical and philosophical training in the schools of athens the extent of whose suppression by theodosius a century before is grossly exaggerated by the superficial .
men of learning suspect it little, and ignore it mostly .
of this he had been assured by frank elwood, the one fellow student whose poverty forced him to room in this squalid and unpopular house .
as the weeks passed, i observed with regret that my new friend was indeed slowly but unmistakably losing ground physically, as mrs  . herrero had suggested.
then, with a dazed automatism which persisted despite hopelessness, i made for the next connecting door and performed the blind motion of pushing at it in an effort to get through and granting that fastenings might be as providentially intact as in this second room bolt the hall door beyond before the lock could be turned from outside .
shall i say that the voice was deep; hollow; gelatinous; remote; unearthly; inhuman; disembodied?
he read avidly by himself now; but talked much less than formerly .
finally the air grew thin, and the sky changed colour, and the climbers found it hard to breathe; but still they toiled up and up, marvelling at the strangeness of the scene and thrilling at the thought of what would happen on the summit when the moon was out and the pale vapours spread around .
so taking the solitary acetylene lamp into the adjacent laboratory, we left our silent guest on the slab in the dark, and bent every energy to the mixing of a new solution; the weighing and measuring supervised by west with an almost fanatical care .
at last came that which i had long feared .
but before his resolution was put to the test, the unexpected intervened .
she had found it in the young gentleman 's bed on the side next the wall .
what was it that had enmeshed him?
many things had taught them secretiveness, and there was now no need to exert pressure on them .
though the hands of its clock were missing on the side i glimpsed, i knew that those hoarse strokes were telling the hour of eleven .
all of these, however, bore out the notes in full .
professor upham especially liked his demonstration of the kinship of higher mathematics to certain phases of magical lore transmitted down the ages from an ineffable antiquity human or pre human whose knowledge of the cosmos and its laws was greater than ours .
like and yet unlike, for there was in the eyes of all a weird, unhealthy glitter as of greed, ambition, vindictiveness, or misguided zeal .
to seek to describe it were useless for it was such that no description is possible .
 ''everybody was in a bad way them days .
here the strangers had been granted a haven; and the swarthy etienne roulet, less apt at agriculture than at reading queer books and drawing queer diagrams, was given a clerical post in the warehouse at pardon tillinghast 's wharf, far south in town street .
but still these shadows of my dream deride me .
one september day an unexpected glimpse of him induced an epileptic fit in a man who had come to repair his electric desk lamp; a fit for which he prescribed effectively whilst keeping himself well out of sight .
so without delay west had injected into the body 's wrist the compound which would hold it fresh for use after my arrival .
everybody shrieked when a large rat like form suddenly jumped out from beneath the ensanguined bedclothes and scuttled across the floor to a fresh, open hole close by .
it is perhaps worth mentioning that i was not at all surprised or terrified on learning of the nature of the vault .
then he saw the old woman and the small furry thing advancing toward him over the carpeted floor .
there was a suggestion of sound, too, though the wind was blowing the other way a suggestion of bestial scraping and bellowing even worse than the muttering of the parties i had lately overheard .
i, a german, should be the first to tread those aeon forgotten ways i produced and examined a deep sea diving suit of joined metal, and experimented with the portable light and air regenerator .
for the cat is cryptic, and close to strange things which men cannot see .
the far corners were all shadows, and the whole place took on a hazy unreality which obscured its nature and invited the imagination to symbolism and phantasm .
he was, in fine, made sensible that all the world is but the smoke of our intellects; past the bidding of the vulgar, but by the wise to be puffed out and drawn in like any cloud of prime virginia tobacco .
ironic humour dragged down all the twilight minarets he reared, and the earthy fear of improbability blasted all the delicate and amazing flowers in his faery gardens .
west and i were doing post graduate work in summer classes at the medical school of miskatonic university, and my friend had attained a wide notoriety because of his experiments leading toward the revivification of the dead .
honest, wholesome structures do not stare at travellers so slyly and hauntingly, and in my genealogical researches i had encountered legends of a century before which biassed me against places of this kind .
my eyes, however, never turned away from the horrible opening at the base of the chimney; and i began to get glimpses of the crumbling bricks and unhealthy weeds as faint glows of lightning penetrated the woods outside and illumined the chinks in the upper wall .
far into the night they discussed, and the next day was a whirlwind of preparation on the part of them all .
at the time, indeed, my attention was distracted from this matter by another phenomenon; a phenomenon so fleeting that i could not take oath upon its reality .
i climbed gentle hills from whose summits i could see entrancing panoramas of loveliness, with steepled towns nestling in verdant valleys, and with the golden domes of gigantic cities glittering on the infinitely distant horizon .
and on the thirty first day that we followed the bird, we beheld the basalt pillars of the west .
the marsh still glittered beyond, but in the farther distance i saw the steeples of what was then all of new york; trinity and st  . paul 's and the brick church dominating their sisters, and a faint haze of wood smoke hovering over the whole.
you say to me that there is nothing in the swamp or near it which could form the setting of that frightful episode .
the light was not white but violet, and seemed less like true light than like some radio active bombardment .
then there came a subdued sort of clatter which somehow set me all in gooseflesh a furtive, groping kind of clatter, though i can 't attempt to convey what i mean in words .
at last i could feel a real shiver run through manton, who had moved very near .
my programme, i decided, would be to thread the principal streets, talk with any non natives i might encounter, and catch the eight o 'clock coach for arkham .
always an ice cold intellectual machine; slight, blond, blue eyed, and spectacled; i think he secretly sneered at my occasional martial enthusiasms and censures of supine neutrality .
brown jenkin, tough of sinew and with four tiny hands of daemoniac dexterity, had been busy while the witch was throttling him, and his efforts had been in vain .
in this fearless explorer had been placed in a madhouse at huntingdon .
but the villagers did not discuss such things with the old man and his wife; because of the habitual expression on the withered faces of the two, and because their cottage was so small and so darkly hidden under spreading oaks at the back of a neglected yard .
as i stood pondering with my hand on the now useless switch i heard a muffled creaking on the floor below, and thought i could barely distinguish voices in conversation .
 ''oh, thet afriky book?
there it still stood on the night i dug in jan martense 's grave .
in the evening barry dined with me and announced that he would begin the drainage in two days .
as he listened he thought a rhythmic confusion of faint musical pipings covering a wide tonal range welled up from the narrow streets beneath, and he wished he might discern the denizens of the place .
his feet were indistinguishable because of the table and bench, but he must have been shod, since there was a clicking whenever he changed position .
all this, to the pious miss tilton, formed an excellent reason for shunning the ancient town of decay and desolation; but to me it was merely a fresh incentive .
just as the building was wiped out by a german shell, there had been a success .
and it was by moonlight that we anchored at last in the harbour of sona nyl, which is guarded by twin headlands of crystal that rise from the sea and meet in a resplendent arch .
on the floor were confused muddy prints, but oddly enough they did not extend all the way to the door .
alone i mounted the tower, for every man of stout body was needed in the passes below .
but as leaving time obviously approached i conquered my qualms and followed the man aboard, extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single word  ''innsmouth '' .
seized with a gloomy and fanatical belief which exiled them from their kind, their ancestors sought the wilderness for freedom .
in his dream delirium gilman heard the hellish, alien rhythmed chant of the sabbat coming from an infinite distance, and knew the black man must be there .
a struggle, a needle, and a powerful alkaloid had transformed it to a very fresh corpse, and the experiment had succeeded for a brief and memorable moment; but west had emerged with a soul calloused and seared, and a hardened eye which sometimes glanced with a kind of hideous and calculating appraisal at men of especially sensitive brain and especially vigorous physique .
the building was full of a frightful stench which dr  . armitage knew too well, and the three men rushed across the hall to the small genealogical reading room whence the low whining came.
but alfred trever did not speak the truth, as many guessed when he offered to take charge of the body and secure its interment in appleton .
before i had protested at his unnatural pryings into the unthinkable; now that he had evidently succeeded to some degree i almost shared his spirit, terrible though the cost of victory appeared .
he now refused to admit me at any time, and shunned me whenever we met on the stairs .
here we were comparatively calm, despite a somewhat puzzling southward current which we could not identify from our oceanographic charts .
i can see him now as he was then and i shiver .
from beyond came a glow that weirdly lit the giant twisted trees and the tops of the buried temples, and i drifted on songfully, expectant of the glories of the land from whence i should never return .
a very thin sprinkling of repellent looking youngish people now became visible on the sidewalks lone individuals, and silent knots of two or three .
but i might not be mad if those accursed tomb legions had not been so silent .
a couple o  ' weeks later, when nothin' had ben throwed into the sea fer that long   . . .
and yet i could extract nothing definite from the man .
even now he could detect a low, monstrous shaking whose tempo he suspected all too well .
upon that sea the hateful moon shone, and over its unvocal waves weird perfumes brooded .
and golden flames played about weedy locks, so that olney was dazzled as he did them homage .
it was to a time battered edifice of this description that i was driven one afternoon in november, , by a rain of such chilling copiousness that any shelter was preferable to exposure .
them as was born more like the things changed arly, but them as was nearly human sometimes stayed on the island till they was past seventy, though they 'd usually go daown under fer trial trips afore that .
as i considered the inevitable end my mind ran over preceding events, and developed a hitherto dormant impression which would have caused a weaker and more superstitious man to shudder .
and as i looked upon the little gate in the mighty wall, i felt that beyond it lay a dream country from which, once it was entered, there would be no return .
my uncle, it seems, had quickly instituted a prodigiously far flung body of inquiries amongst nearly all the friends whom he could question without impertinence, asking for nightly reports of their dreams, and the dates of any notable visions for some time past .
the deep ones could never be destroyed, even though the palaeogean magic of the forgotten old ones might sometimes check them .
he did not walk or climb, fly or swim, crawl or wriggle; yet always experienced a mode of motion partly voluntary and partly involuntary .
yet i had read only the least fragment of that blasphemous rune before closing the book and bringing it away .
sometimes, in the throes of a nightmare when unseen powers whirl one over the roofs of strange dead cities toward the grinning chasm of nis, it is a relief and even a delight to shriek wildly and throw oneself voluntarily along with the hideous vortex of dream doom into whatever bottomless gulf may yawn .
apparently it was a point somewhere between hydra and argo navis, and he knew that he had been urged toward it ever since he had awaked soon after dawn .
one other thing is curious .
louder and louder, wilder and wilder, mounted the shrieking and whining of that desperate viol .
having taken the fortified places at the foot of the mountains, their way now lay open to the plateau, unless every citizen could resist with the strength of ten men .
methought its spirit whispered evil counsel, soothing me to traitorous somnolence with a damnable rhythmical promise which it repeated over and over:   ''slumber, watcher, till the spheres six and twenty thousand years have revolv'd, and i return to the spot where now i burn .
one might easily imagine an alien nucleus of substance or energy, formless or otherwise, kept alive by imperceptible or immaterial subtractions from the life force or bodily tissues and fluids of other and more palpably living things into which it penetrates and with whose fabric it sometimes completely merges itself .
people sometimes heard the queerest kind of sounds .
the trail up and down sentinel hill seemed to armitage of almost cataclysmic significance, and he looked long at the sinister altar like stone on the summit .
for the moment his recollections were hopelessly hazy, but he knew at least that he must have been sleep walking .
i was not alone, for foolhardiness was not then mixed with that love of the grotesque and the terrible which has made my career a series of quests for strange horrors in literature and in life .
it was he who wisely advised the burgesses of ulthar when they passed their remarkable law against the slaying of cats, and who first told the young priest atal where it is that black cats go at midnight on st  . john 's eve.
in the spring after wilbur 's birth lavinia resumed her customary rambles in the hills, bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy child .
klenze had gone mad and perished before reaching this sinister remnant of a past unwholesomely remote, and had advised me to go with him .
wudn  't bother no strangers as might bear tales aoutside that is, withaout they got pryin' .
i wondered for a moment what the strange affliction of this man might be, and whether his obstinate refusal of outside aid were not the result of a rather baseless eccentricity .
but business is business, and to a robber whose soul is in his profession, there is a lure and a challenge about a very old and very feeble man who has no account at the bank, and who pays for his few necessities at the village store with spanish gold and silver minted two centuries ago .
he had not mentioned this before, but now he must tell about it because it meant that keziah and her long toothed familiar were haunting the young gentleman .
but it was lonely among strangers, so barry had asked me to come .
in the sunshine of the morning the proxenoi led the tyrant 's messengers up the slope to the abode of the sculptor, but the night wind had done strange things .
one case, which the note describes with emphasis, was very sad .
it was the terrible season of the autumn, and the wild people in the mountains were preparing for the frightful ceremonies which only rumour told of in the towns .
the first comer now went to a cupboard on the inner side of the room and extracted a coil of rope .
within twenty four hours the stranger had become so bright that it outshone capella .
from some farmhouse far away came the frantic barking of dogs .
he had been found covered with blood and shreds of flesh in a wood, shortly after the killing and rending of a boy by a pair of wolves .
i tried to raise my hand to shut out the sight, yet so stunned were my nerves that my arm could not fully obey my will .
and the mists of the dawn are thicker, and sailors are not quite so sure that all the muffled seaward ringing is that of the solemn buoys .
dangers he met unflinchingly; crimes he committed unmoved .
i had often heard of this work, with its curious illustrations by the brothers de bry, hence for a moment forgot my uneasiness in my desire to turn the pages before me .
at the end of the corridor was a bathroom a discouraging relique with ancient marble bowl, tin tub, faint electric light, and musty wooden panelling around all the plumbing fixtures .
morning came wanly, and the night sounds ceased .
and he gazed also upon mount aran rising regally from the shore, its lower slopes green with swaying trees and its white summit touching the sky .
i did not like those rumours of a fight which were floating about .
had i not a right to rest till eternity amongst the descendants of sir geoffrey hyde?
disintegration is quite painless, i assure you but i want you to see them .
before carter awaked, the gentle visitant had told him where to find that box; that carved oak box of archaic wonder whose grotesque lid no hand had raised for two centuries .
also, dombrowski must attend to the poisoning of those rats in the walls .
then i saw the lurid shimmering of pale light, and heard the insidious lapping of sunless waters .
this ancient confirmed every tale which jermyn had heard, adding his own account of the stone city and the white apes as it had been told to him .
sleep seized me quickly, and i was at once haunted with dreams of the most disturbing kind .
the patterns all hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable abysses in time and space, and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister .
one detail that annoyed me was the distribution of the few faint sounds i heard .
the change, it was said, came simultaneously with the innsmouth epidemic of , and was thought by simple folk to have a dark connexion with hidden forces of evil .
johansen and his men landed at a sloping mud bank on this monstrous acropolis, and clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which could have been no mortal staircase .
birch, being by temperament phlegmatic and practical, did not shout long; but proceeded to grope about for some tools which he recalled seeing in a corner of the tomb .
and the young men who had returned dwelt there no longer .
he must have been trapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss, or else the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy .
i watched from midnight to one o 'clock, when in spite of the sinister house, the unprotected window, and the approaching thunder and lightning, i felt singularly drowsy .
it faced south, with one gable end buried to the lower windows in the eastward rising hill, and the other exposed to the foundations toward the street .
maounds o   ' the dead an' the dyin'    . . .
in another second i was alone in the accursed mansion, shivering and gibbering .
ahead was the robed black man he had seen in the peaked space in the other dream, while from a lesser distance the old woman was beckoning and grimacing imperiously .
let us go to oonai, o iranon of the golden head, where men shall know our longings and welcome us as brothers, nor ever laugh or frown at what we say . ''
he paused exhausted, as the whole group of natives stared in a bewilderment not quite crystallised into fresh terror .
with the years the legends take on a spectral character i suppose the thing, if it was a living thing, must have died .
up the long drive rolled the coaches of the boston gentry, whilst on foot came a numerous assemblage of powdered exquisites from the neighbouring mansions .
the material seemed to be predominantly gold, though a weird lighter lustrousness hinted at some strange alloy with an equally beautiful and scarcely identifiable metal .
into the sunset wandered iranon, seeking still for his native land and for men who would understand and cherish his songs and dreams .
hasheesh helped a great deal, and once sent him to a part of space where form does not exist, but where glowing gases study the secrets of existence .
i seemed to know where i was, but cannot recall what i then knew .
i have said that i dwelt apart from the visible world, but i have not said that i dwelt alone .
these persons were not all cut off suddenly by any one cause; rather did it seem that their vitality was insidiously sapped, so that each one died the sooner from whatever tendency to weakness he may have naturally had .
his build and lower facial features were like other clergymen i had seen, but he had a vastly higher forehead, and was darker and more intelligent looking also more subtly and concealedly evil looking .
on another night kuranes walked up a damp stone spiral stairway endlessly, and came to a tower window overlooking a mighty plain and river lit by the full moon; and in the silent city that spread away from the river bank he thought he beheld some feature or arrangement which he had known before .
the matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me, and at times i had visions of personal fame from researches into its origin and connexions .
and for seventeen years after that west would look frequently over his shoulder, and complain of fancied footsteps behind him .
and old folk tell of pleasing voices heard singing there, and of laughter that swells with joys beyond earth 's joys; and say that at evening the little low windows are brighter than formerly .
how little does the earth self know of life and its extent how little, indeed, ought it to know for its own tranquillity of the oppressor i cannot speak .
and behind the houses were walled rose gardens with hedged paths and sundials, where at evening the moon and stars would shine bewitchingly while fragrant blossoms glistened with dew .
drawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter, i once more consulted the grocery boy 's map with the aid of the flashlight .
he did not respond, and still the viol shrieked on without slackening .
it is well that the reader accept nothing which follows as objective truth, for since the events transcend natural law, they are necessarily the subjective and unreal creations of my overtaxed mind .
i returned to the boat as my electric batteries grew feeble, resolved to explore the rock temple on the following day .
being now afraid to live alone in the ancient house on the moor, i departed on the following day for london, taking with me the amulet after destroying by fire and burial the rest of the impious collection in the museum .
it   's a frightful thing to have alive, but it isn't as bad as what wilbur would have let in if he'd lived longer .
he lives all alone with his streaked cat in gray 's inn, and people call him harmlessly mad .
he was principal of the east high school, born and bred in boston and sharing new england 's self satisfied deafness to the delicate overtones of life .
when near the front door he seemed to think of something, and turned back in his flight, finally disappearing down the stairs to the cellar .
the hermes of kalos stood in a marble shrine in corinth, and the pallas of musides surmounted a pillar in athens, near the parthenon .
after an interval, however, we approached the pit again, and found the exhalations less unbearable .
those scars was it like that? ''
and that look in the staring eyed faces of my grandmother and self slain uncle might be sheer fancy on my part sheer fancy, bolstered up by the innsmouth shadow which had so darkly coloured my imagination .
of scepticism there was none .
warning me that many of the street signs were down, the youth drew for my benefit a rough but ample and painstaking sketch map of the town 's salient features .
over the seas there was a great victory, and in triumph most of the young men returned .
and a thousand years of riches and delight passed over sarnath, wonder of the world and pride of all mankind .
alone i buried him beneath the stones of the courtyard about which he had loved to wander in life .
it struck me as horribly like a sort of oriental ceremony, with beating of drums and chanting of many voices .
he got this in london, i guess he uster like ter buy things at the shops .
nevertheless i followed him; for in those dreary days my quest for antique beauty and mystery was all that i had to keep my soul alive, and i reckoned it a rare favour of fate to fall in with one whose kindred seekings seemed to have penetrated so much farther than mine .

it was useless to provide many things, for we should find abundant provision in every town .
they fly quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an english stagecoach .

perpetual fear had jaundiced his complexion, and shrivelled his whole person .
the sun set; the atmosphere grew dim and the evening star no longer shone companionless .
the rain ceased; the clouds sunk behind the horizon; it was now evening, and the sun descended swiftly the western sky .

i dared, i conquered them all, till now i have sold myself to death, with the sole condition that thou shouldst follow me fire, and war, and plague, unite for thy destruction o my raymond, there is no safety for thee '' with an heavy heart i listened to the changes of her delirium; i made her a bed of cloaks; her violence decreased and a clammy dew stood on her brow as the paleness of death succeeded to the crimson of fever, i placed her on the cloaks .
the next morning i delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors .
nor did raymond make an end without drawing in vivid and glowing colours, the splendour of a kingdom, in opposition to the commercial spirit of republicanism .
the stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which i had before understood, but i profited by the others .
each people looked on the coming struggle as that which would be to a great degree decisive; as, in case of victory, the next step would be the siege of constantinople by the greeks .
my lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in his profession .
to be near him, to be loved by him, to feel him again her own, was the limit of her desires .
the sky was serene; and, as i was unable to rest, i resolved to visit the spot where my poor william had been murdered .
all that he said threw greatly into the shade cornelius agrippa, albertus magnus, and paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies .
the ex queen gives me idris; adrian is totally unfitted to succeed to the earldom, and that earldom in my hands becomes a kingdom .

he came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation .
i had expected some extravagant proposition, and remained silent awhile, collecting my thoughts that i might the better combat her fanciful scheme .
they still appeared in public together, and lived under the same roof .
he began to answer with violence:  ''yes, yes, i hate you you are my bane, my poison, my disgust oh no '' and then his manner changed, and fixing his eyes on me with an expression that convulsed every nerve and member of my frame  ''you are none of all these; you are my light, my only one, my life .
besides, perdita was with him in his retirement; she saw the moodiness that succeeded to this forced hilarity; she marked his disturbed sleep, his painful irritability once she had seen his tears hers had scarce ceased to flow, since she had beheld the big drops which disappointed pride had caused to gather in his eye, but which pride was unable to dispel .
i packed up my chemical instruments and the materials i had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of scotland .
my skin was embrowned by the sun; my step was firm with conscious power .
i started forward and exclaimed,  ''villain before you sign my death warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe . ''
he determined to extract and condense all of glory, power, and achievement, which might have resulted from a long reign, into the three years of his protectorate .
they had received orders that if i were again taken, i should be brought to the earl; and his lenity made them expect a conclusion which they considered ill befitting my crime .
six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and i stood in the same place where i had last embraced my father before my departure for ingolstadt .
i had now spent many hours in tears and mournful meditation; it was past twelve o 'clock; all was at peace in the house, and the gentle air that stole in at my window did not rustle the leaves of the twining plants that shadowed it .
look, i weep: for more than two years i have never enjoyed one moment free from anguish .
justine was called on for her defence .
my words flowed spontaneously my utterance was firm and quick .
he obeyed her injunctions, and passed a year in exile in cumberland .
he reverted to his past life, his successes in greece, his favour at home .
i look on the hands which executed the deed; i think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more .
horrible sights were shaped to me in the turbid cloud that hovered over the city; and my only relief was derived from the struggles i made to approach the gate .
i resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated and despised, every country must be equally horrible .
i will protect the first the latter i commit to your charge .
miserable himself that he may render no other wretched, he ought to die .
it is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin .
she often repined; but her trust in the singleness of his affection was undisturbed; and, when they were together, unchecked by fear, she opened her heart to the fullest delight .
he was full of thought, and remained silent during a considerable part of our ride; at length he said,   ''i must apologize to you for my abstraction; the truth is, ryland's motion comes on to night, and i am considering my reply . ''
raymond did not wonder, that, thus situated, the artist had shrunk from notice, but he did not for this alter his resolve .
but while i endured punishment and pain in their defence with the spirit of an hero, i claimed as my reward their praise and obedience .
i must collect my thoughts .
 ''not so, '' said i,  ''though i confess that my thoughts are not occupied as pleasantly as yours are .
 ''surely it is not the custom of englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably . ''
they remained confined for five months before the trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country .
these are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river .
if manly courage and resistance can save us, we will be saved .
the silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love .
i commenced by inuring my body to hardship .
i travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human being .
adrian had introduced systematic modes of proceeding in the metropolis, which, while they were unable to stop the progress of death, yet prevented other evils, vice and folly, from rendering the awful fate of the hour still more tremendous .
the extreme darkness of the stage, whose only light was received from the fire under the cauldron, joined to a kind of mist that floated about it, rendered the unearthly shapes of the witches obscure and shadowy .
for a long time i dared not hope; but when his unobstructed breathing and the moisture that suffused his forehead, were tokens no longer to be mistaken of the departure of mortal malady, i ventured to whisper the news of the change to idris, and at length succeeded in persuading her that i spoke truth .
my first thought was perdita; to her i must return; her i must support, drawing such food from despair as might best sustain her wounded heart; recalling her from the wild excesses of grief, by the austere laws of duty, and the soft tenderness of regret .
he owned affinity not only with mankind, but all nature was akin to him; the mountains and sky were his friends; the winds of heaven and the offspring of earth his playmates; while he the focus only of this mighty mirror, felt his life mingle with the universe of existence .
alfred stood immoveable before him, his whole attention absorbed .
leave me; i am inexorable . ''
i listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply .
you hate me, but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which i regard myself .
he made a vow against love and its train of struggles, disappointment and remorse, and sought in mere sensual enjoyment, a remedy for the injurious inroads of passion .
i provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother, and departed .
i rushed towards the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake .
she might have heard of my return from london, and my visit to bolter 's lock, which, connected with my continued absence, might tend greatly to alarm her .
this man, whose name was beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence .
we found, on each side of the humid pathway,  ''dry land for the sole of the foot . ''
i dare not ask you to do what i think right, for i may still be misled by passion .
since then i must be an object of indifference or contempt to her, better, far better avoid her, nor expose myself before her and the scornful world to the chance of playing the mad game of a fond, foolish icarus .
i shewed her the dangers which her children incurred during her absence; and she at length agreed not to go beyond the inclosure of the forest .
the remains of the half finished creature, whom i had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and i almost felt as if i had mangled the living flesh of a human being .
then again the kindly influence ceased to act i found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection .
his feelings are forever on the stretch; and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties .
 ''the father of safie had been the cause of their ruin .
 ''my children, '' she said,  ''my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union .
i will win him to me; he shall not deny his grief to me and when i know his secret then will i pour a balm into his soul and again i shall enjoy the ravishing delight of beholding his smile, and of again seeing his eyes beam if not with pleasure at least with gentle love and thankfulness .
i soon arrived at the hut: the door was ajar .
for a moment i was almost paralized by fear; but my energy returned and i demanded a guide to accompany me in following his steps .
i could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery .
i remembered in one of her harshest moments a quotation of mine had roused her to anger and disdain .
about two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before night the ice broke and freed our ship .

adrian led the troops .

he found my name a good passport to preferment, and he had procured for me the situation of private secretary to the ambassador at vienna, where i should enter on my career under the best auspices .
but on you only had i any claim for pity and redress, and from you i determined to seek that justice which i vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form .
i strove to think that all this grandeur was but more glaring infamy, and that, by planting his gold enwoven flag beside my tarnished and tattered banner, he proclaimed not his superiority, but his debasement .

everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible .
i gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as i had given to his fellow professor .
as the music went on, my ideas seemed to quit their mortal dwelling house; they shook their pinions and began a flight, sailing on the placid current of thought, filling the creation with new glory, and rousing sublime imagery that else had slept voiceless .
i waited for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed i was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and i saw the superscription of elizabeth or my father, i hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate .
one fine february day, when the sun had reassumed some of its genial power, i walked in the forest with my family .
at this time lord raymond returned from greece .
bread and water did not tame my blood, nor solitary confinement inspire me with gentle thoughts .
i carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity .
the gentle words of agatha and the animated smiles of the charming arabian were not for me .
alas life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated .
i was struck by the improvement that appeared in the health of adrian .
 ''are you better now, sir? '' said she .
another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house; it was not cold .
his appearance, different from any i had ever before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me .
i am thy creature, and i will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me .
nor did i doubt, that in the tranquillity of our family circle at windsor, she would recover some degree of composure, and in the end, of happiness .
no man could crush a  ''butterfly on the wheel '' with better effect; no man better cover a speedy retreat from a powerful adversary .
their still apparent union permitted her to do much; but no woman could, in the end, present a remedy to the encreasing negligence of the protector; who, as if seized with a paroxysm of insanity, trampled on all ceremony, all order, all duty, and gave himself up to license .
the rooks cawed loudly in the trees above; mixed with their hoarse cries i heard a lively strain of music .
no sympathy may i ever find .
i suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for mr  . kirwin hastened to say,  ''immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on your person were brought me, and i examined them that i might discover some trace by which i could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness.
as soon as morning dawned i crept from my kennel, that i might view the adjacent cottage and discover if i could remain in the habitation i had found .
elinor die this is frenzy and the most miserable despair: you cannot die while i am near . ''
our talk was on subjects, unconnected with the emotions that evidently occupied each; but we each divined the other 's thought, and as our voices spoke of indifferent matters, our eyes, in mute language, told a thousand things no tongue could have uttered .
nor did adrian instruct me only in the cold truths of history and philosophy .
   'let me go,' he cried; 'monster ugly wretch you wish to eat me and tear me to pieces .
in the open air alone i found relief; among nature 's beauteous works, her god reassumed his attribute of benevolence, and again i could trust that he who built up the mountains, planted the forests, and poured out the rivers, would erect another state for lost humanity, where we might awaken again to our affections, our happiness, and our faith .
  ''vase am i, '' she thought,  ''vase brimful of despair's direst essence .
he alluded to adrian, and spoke of him with that disparagement that the worldly wise always attach to enthusiasm .
i recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished .
raymond had evidently vacillated during his journey, and irresolution was marked in every gesture as we entered perdita 's cottage .
when my father had arrived the storm had already begun, but he had refused to stop and leaving his horse there he walked on towards the sea .
alas, what will become of us?
 ''the relatives of the earl of windsor, '' said she haughtily,  ''doubtless think that i injured him; perhaps the earl himself would be the first to acquit me, but probably i do not deserve acquittal .
his demeanour was sad; for a moment he appeared glad to see me and then he checked himself as if unwilling to betray his feelings .
the wound, and consequent inability of argyropylo, caused raymond to be the first in command .
i often wished that i had permitted her to take her own course, and engage herself in such labours for the welfare of others as might have distracted her thoughts .
now, beware be silent do not urge me to your destruction .
we went out with the resolution of disputing with our foe .
we will fight the enemy to the last .
i spoke without much heed, and the very conclusion of what i said brought with it other thoughts .
she reposed beside her beloved, and the tomb above was inscribed with the united names of raymond and perdita .
her story was plain to him, plain and distinct as the remorse and horror that darted their fangs into him .
if i wept he would gaze on me in silence but he was no longer harsh and although he repulsed every caress yet it was with gentleness .
these sounds were mingled with the roaring of the sea, the splash of the chafed billows round the vessel 's sides, and the gurgling up of the water in the hold .
but i could discover, amidst all her repinings, deep resentment towards raymond, and an unfading sense of injury, that plucked from me my hope, when i appeared nearest to its fulfilment .
he rode through the town, visiting the wounded, and giving such orders as were necessary for the siege he meditated .
this was not altogether the fact: but predominant self will assumed the arms and masque of callous feeling; and the haughty lady disdained to exhibit any token of the struggle she endured; while the slave of pride, she fancied that she sacrificed her happiness to immutable principle .
i was now in holborn, and passed by a public house filled with uproarious companions, whose songs, laughter, and shouts were more sorrowful than the pale looks and silence of the mourner .
i rambled on, oppressed, distracted by painful emotions suddenly i found myself before drury lane theatre .
excellent friend how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own .
while in london these and many other dreadful thoughts too harrowing for words were my portion: i lost all this suffering when i was free; when i saw the wild heath around me, and the evening star in the west, then i could weep, gently weep, and be at peace .
 ''what can i do? '' she cried,  ''i am lost we are both for ever lost but come come with me, lionel; here i must not stay, we can get a chaise at the nearest post house; yet perhaps we have time come, o come with me to save and protect me '' when i heard her piteous demands, while with disordered dress, dishevelled hair, and aghast looks, she wrung her hands the idea shot across me is she also mad?  ''sweet one, '' and i folded her to my heart,  ''better repose than wander further; rest my beloved, i will make a fire you are chill . ''
my productions however were sufficiently unpretending; they were confined to the biography of favourite historical characters, especially those whom i believed to have been traduced, or about whom clung obscurity and doubt .
but i was enchanted by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as pandemonium appeared to the demons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire .
she received these tokens of returning love with gentleness; she did not shun his company; but she endeavoured to place a barrier in the way of familiar intercourse or painful discussion, which mingled pride and shame prevented raymond from surmounting .
here were the future governors of england; the men, who, when our ardour was cold, and our projects completed or destroyed for ever, when, our drama acted, we doffed the garb of the hour, and assumed the uniform of age, or of more equalizing death; here were the beings who were to carry on the vast machine of society; here were the lovers, husbands, fathers; here the landlord, the politician, the soldier; some fancied that they were even now ready to appear on the stage, eager to make one among the dramatis personae of active life .
evadne, once the idol of adrian 's affections; and who, for the sake of her present visitor, had disdained the noble youth, and then, neglected by him she loved, with crushed hopes and a stinging sense of misery, had returned to her native greece .
but i was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition .
but this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust .
great god if for one instant i had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, i would rather have banished myself forever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage .
in this manner i distributed my occupations when i first arrived, but as i proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me .
such a monster has, then, really existence i cannot doubt it, yet i am lost in surprise and admiration .
it is hard for one so young who was once so happy as i was; sic voluntarily to divest themselves of all sensation and to go alone to the dreary grave; i dare not .
in her resentful mood, these expressions had been remembered with acrimony and disdain; they visited her in her softened hour, taking sleep from her eyes, all hope of rest from her uneasy mind .
god raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst .
give me the name of friend; i will fulfill its duties; and if for a moment complaint and sorrow would shape themselves into words let me be near to speak peace to your vext soul . ''
her manners were cold and repulsive .
she is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as i mentioned before, her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt .
soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my cousin .

i listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; i expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor, without letting escape inexperience in life would have made me ashamed any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours .
i have consorted long with grief, entered the gloomy labyrinth of madness, and emerged, but half alive .
my life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but i preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path .
some reflection seemed to sting him, and the spasm of pain that for a moment convulsed his countenance, checked my indignation .
the chamber was full but there was no protector; and there was an austere discontent manifest on the countenances of the leaders, and a whispering and busy tattle among the underlings, not less ominous .

i traversed the streets without any clear conception of where i was or what i was doing .
i was weary with watching and for some time i had combated with the heavy sleep that weighed down my eyelids: but now, no longer fearful, i threw myself on my bed .

then again she sadly lamented her hard fate; that a woman, with a woman 's heart and sensibility, should be driven by hopeless love and vacant hopes to take up the trade of arms, and suffer beyond the endurance of man privation, labour, and pain the while her dry, hot hand pressed mine, and her brow and lips burned with consuming fire .
she had gone to hide her weakness; escaping from the castle, she had descended to the little park, and sought solitude, that she might there indulge her tears; i found her clinging round an old oak, pressing its rough trunk with her roseate lips, as her tears fell plenteously, and her sobs and broken exclamations could not be suppressed; with surpassing grief i beheld this loved one of my heart thus lost in sorrow i drew her towards me; and, as she felt my kisses on her eyelids, as she felt my arms press her, she revived to the knowledge of what remained to her  .

as long as their disunion remained a secret, he cherished an expectation of re awakening past tenderness in her bosom; now that we were all made acquainted with these occurrences, and that perdita, by declaring her resolves to others, in a manner pledged herself to their accomplishment, he gave up the idea of re union as futile, and sought only, since he was unable to influence her to change, to reconcile himself to the present state of things .

alas i knew not the desart it was about to reach; the rocks that would tear its waters, and the hideous scene that would be reflected in a more distorted manner in its waves .
my heart beat quick as i approached the palings; my hand was on one of them, a leap would take me to the other side, when two keepers sprang from an ambush upon me: one knocked me down, and proceeded to inflict a severe horse whipping .
my evil passions will have fled, for i shall meet with sympathy my life will flow quietly away, and in my dying moments i shall not curse my maker . ''
 ''elizabeth lavenza  ''geneva, may th,  '' this letter revived in my memory what i had before forgotten, the threat of the fiend  ''i will be with you on your wedding night '' such was my sentence, and on that night would the daemon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings .
he might have spoken, but i did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but i escaped and rushed downstairs .
i turned author myself .
then, in endeavouring to do violence to my own disposition, i made all worse than before .
his graceful elocution enchained the senses of his hearers .
posterity is no more; fame, and ambition, and love, are words void of meaning; even as the cattle that grazes in the field, do thou, o deserted one, lie down at evening tide, unknowing of the past, careless of the future, for from such fond ignorance alone canst thou hope for ease joy paints with its own colours every act and thought .
the theatre was tolerably well filled .
she was nearly fifteen years older than he, and was the offspring of a former marriage of his father .
they stole off at first by ones and twos, then in larger companies, until, unimpeded by the officers, whole battalions sought the road that led to macedonia .
i am glad that i have loved, and have experienced sympathetic joy and sorrow with my fellow creatures .
i went up to her and offered my services .
he admitted that the principles that i laid down were the best; but he denied that they were the only ones .
and when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived . ''
one of these fragile mirrors, that ever doted on thine image, is about to be broken, crumbled to dust .
calderon de la barca .
he was detained three days longer and then he hastened to her .
and why should i describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel?
but i paused when i reflected on the story that i had to tell .
ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the impetuous arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty .
i did not weep, but i wiped the perspiration from my brow, and tried to still my brain and heart beating almost to madness .
but now i went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands .
we hired a chaise here, and with four horses drove with speed through the storm .
thus, we talked of them, and moralized, as with diminished numbers we returned to windsor castle .
through asia, from the banks of the nile to the shores of the caspian, from the hellespont even to the sea of oman, a sudden panic was driven .
idris, the most affectionate wife, sister and friend, was a tender and loving mother .
but, my dear frankenstein, '' continued he, stopping short and gazing full in my face,  ''i did not before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for several nights . ''
she first assured him of her boundless confidence; of this he must be conscious, since but for that she would not seek to detain him .
he had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck .
 ''abhorred monster fiend that thou art the tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes .
no, all must be changed .
agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but i generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father .
still she felt sure that he would come at last; and the wider the breach might appear at this crisis, the more secure she was of closing it for ever .
yet he was never in better health .
i was beyond measure disturbed by this intelligence .
 ''your arrival, my dear cousin, '' said she,  ''fills me with hope .
what, if circumstance should lead perdita to suspect, and suspecting to be resolved?
the wind, prince of air, raged through his kingdom, lashing the sea into fury, and subduing the rebel earth into some sort of obedience .
the season of the assizes approached .
   'by your language, stranger, i suppose you are my countryman; are you french?'  '''no; but i was educated by a french family and understand that language only .
we rapidly drew near, so that at length the number and forms of those within could be discerned; its dark sides grew big, and the splash of its oars became audible: i could distinguish the languid form of my friend, as he half raised himself at our approach .
perdita was still to a great degree uneducated .
i feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion .
after all we miscalculated .
his health was impaired beyond hope of cure; and it became his earnest wish, before he died, to preserve his daughter from the poverty which would be the portion of her orphan state .
young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, m  . clerval: i was myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time. ''
had i never quitted windsor, these emotions would not have been so intense; but i had in greece been the prey of fear and deplorable change; in greece, after a period of anxiety and sorrow, i had seen depart two, whose very names were the symbol of greatness and virtue .
oh not the ten thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution .
 ''and do you dream? '' said the daemon .
i lived in a temple glorified by intensest sense of devotion and rapture; i walked, a consecrated being, contemplating only your power, your excellence; for o, you stood beside me, like my youth, transformed for me the real to a dream, cloathing the palpable and familiar with golden exhalations of the dawn .
many went up as high as belfast to ensure a shorter passage, and then journeying south through scotland, they were joined by the poorer natives of that country, and all poured with one consent into england .
but it was not so; thou didst seek my extinction, that i might not cause greater wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which i feel .
among these, and highly distinguished by her, was prince zaimi, ambassador to england from the free states of greece; and his daughter, the young princess evadne, passed much of her time at windsor castle .
 ''another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings .
at first, i had spoken only to those nearest me; but the whole assembly gathered about me, and i found that i was listened to by all .
shame seemed to hold him back; yet he evidently wished to establish a renewal of confidence and affection .
i obtained from my father a respite of some weeks .
we were in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed .
this may not be; cease to argue the point, for i cannot consent . ''
he was perfectly self possessed; he accosted us both with courtesy, seemed immediately to enter into our feelings, and to make one with us .
for a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers .
six years have passed since i resolved on my present undertaking .
the very boldness of his language gave him weight; each knew that he spoke truth a truth known, but not acknowledged .
we assembled again towards evening, and perdita insisted on our having recourse to music .
you well know that on the whole earth there is no sacrifise that i would not make, no labour that i would not undergo with the mere hope that i might bring you ease .
in the heart of one like me there are secret thoughts working, and secret tortures which you ought not to seek to discover .
supporting her as i did, still she lagged: and at the distance of half a mile, after many stoppages, shivering fits, and half faintings, she slipt from my supporting arm on the snow, and with a torrent of tears averred that she must be taken, for that she could not proceed .
yet how could i find this?
she alone knew the weight which raymond attached to his success .
she quitted her native greece; her father died; by degrees she was cut off from all the companions and ties of her youth .
he died in debt, and his little property was seized immediately by his creditors .
we talked of the ravages made last year by pestilence in every quarter of the world; and of the dreadful consequences of a second visitation .
i observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished .
but i perceive, too soon for my own happiness, too late for england 's good, that i undertook a task to which i am unequal .
he had vowed to be with me on my wedding night, yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats .
if you feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast a gloom over us .
the nations beneath their influence bowed their heads, and died .
he was forever busy, and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind .
they produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection .
by some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided .
i shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling .
if the multitude of mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for my destruction .
with sincerity and fervour he gave the required promise: as a pledge of continued favour, he received from his royal master a sum of money to defray pressing debts, and enable him to enter under good auspices his new career .
i must arise and examine .
alas for human reason he accused the greeks of superstition: what name did he give to the faith he lent to the predictions of evadne?
from her i should learn the truth concerning our protector; i should hear why she had withdrawn from the protection of the princess evadne, and be instructed as to the influence which this overtopping and towering raymond exercised over the fortunes of my friend .
our nature dim, like to an unlighted torch, sleeps in formless blank till the fire attain it; this life of life, this light to moon, and glory to the sun .
i was indignant that he should sit at the same table with the companions of raymond men of abandoned characters, or rather without any, the refuse of high bred luxury, the disgrace of their country .
when i was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm .
before this event, the little beings, sprung from herself, the young heirs of her transient life, seemed to have a sure lease of existence; now she dreaded that the pitiless destroyer might snatch her remaining darlings, as it had snatched their brother .
 ''thus, '' she cried,  ''kindness can do, what no want, no misery ever effected; i weep . ''
 ''now by the fells of cumberland, '' i cried,  ''by all of the vagabond and poacher that appertains to me, i will stand at your side, draw my sword in the greek cause, and be hailed as a victor along with you '' all the plain, from kishan to rodosto, a distance of sixteen leagues, was alive with troops, or with the camp followers, all in motion at the approach of a battle .
who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of mont saleve?
 ''it was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country man as a guide .
it was not however money, except partially, but the necessaries of life, that became scarce .
how can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this exile?
if i succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you and i may meet .
i found several letters, and, among others, one which i discovered from its commencement to be from your father .
this address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor .
i enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future .
i feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet i was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me .
but adrian read with uncertain aim the charactery of her face, and might mistake .
sometimes she observed the war of elements, thinking that they also declared against her, and listened to the pattering of the rain in gloomy despair .
must we prepare our funeral repast with labour, and with unseemly drudgery heap fuel on our deserted hearths must we with servile hands fabricate the garments, soon to be our shroud?
i had vowed to my own heart never to shadow her countenance even with transient grief, and should i prove recreant at the hour of greatest need?
there was a companionship in suffering there, and, the neighbours keeping constant watch on each other, and inspired by the active benevolence of adrian, succour was afforded, and the path of destruction smoothed .
the moment adrian should be legally elected his deputy, he would escape to safety .
i would walk barefoot through the world, to find an uninfected spot; i would build my home on some wave tossed plank, drifted about on the barren, shoreless ocean .
i cannot lead them unwillingly to danger, and i must return . ''
her hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head .
i replied carelessly, and partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors i had studied .
he however attained his wish; he filled the situation for which nature seemed to have moulded him .
they swept the country like a conquering army, burning laying waste murdering .
when a servant came to ask me if i would take food i learnt from him that my father had returned, and was apparently well and this relieved me from a load of anxiety, yet i did not cease to weep bitterly .
the idea once broached, all were impatient to put it in execution .
preserve her for her own sake i know that you will if you require any other spur, think that, in preserving her, you preserve me .
she did not believe that he was dead, but she knew that he was in danger, and the hope of assisting in his liberation, and the idea of soothing by tenderness the ills that he might have undergone, elevated and harmonized the late jarring element of her being .
i was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my resolution .
the confusion grew their looks of sorrow changed to mockery; they nodded their heads in time to the music, whose clang became maddening .
it is not pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power . ''
thus full of contradictions, unbending yet haughty, gentle yet fierce, tender and again neglectful, he by some strange art found easy entrance to the admiration and affection of women; now caressing and now tyrannizing over them according to his mood, but in every change a despot .
her eyes could not be deeper than they were in childhood, nor her countenance more expressive; but the expression was changed and improved; intelligence sat on her brow; when she smiled her face was embellished by the softest sensibility, and her low, modulated voice seemed tuned by love .
the usual expression of his eyes was soft, though at times he could make them even glare with ferocity; his complexion was colourless; and every trait spoke predominate self will; his smile was pleasing, though disdain too often curled his lips lips which to female eyes were the very throne of beauty and love .
never did any woman appear so entirely made of mind, as the countess of windsor .
idris had shared perdita  's ill opinion of the greek; but raymond's account softened and interested her .
frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man .
but these are precious moments; devil as i am become, yet that is my mathilda before me whom i love as one was never before loved: and she knows it now; she listens to these words which i thought, fool as i was, would blast her to death .
yet, when she stood in unassuming simplicity before us, playing with our children, or with girlish assiduity performing little kind offices for idris, one wondered in what fair lineament of her pure loveliness, in what soft tone of her thrilling voice, so much of heroism, sagacity and active goodness resided .
half england was desolate, when october came, and the equinoctial winds swept over the earth, chilling the ardours of the unhealthy season .
the death of many of our inmates had weaned us from the fond idea, that windsor castle was a spot sacred from the plague; but our lease of life was renewed for some months, and even idris lifted her head, as a lily after a storm, when a last sunbeam tinges its silver cup .
obeying these impulses, he had become the husband of perdita: egged on by them, he found himself the lover of evadne .
she loved him as a kind elder brother; a relation to guide, protect, and instruct her, without the too frequent tyranny of parental authority .
yes it was despair i felt; for the first time that phantom seized me; the first and only time for it has never since left me after the first moments of speechless agony i felt her fangs on my heart: i tore my hair; i raved aloud; at one moment in pity for his sufferings i would have clasped my father in my arms; and then starting back with horror i spurned him with my foot; i felt as if stung by a serpent, as if scourged by a whip of scorpions which drove me ah whither whither?
at length i arrived at the village of chamounix .
the country afforded no such mass of horrors; solitary wretches died in the open fields; and i have found a survivor in a vacant village, contending at once with famine and disease; but the assembly of pestilence, the banqueting hall of death, was spread only in london .
he entreated me to write often .
at the end of a month he suddenly quitted his house and, unatteneded sic by any servant, departed from that part of the country without by word or writing informing any one of his intentions .
during my wanderings i never slept without first calling down gentle dreams on your head .
we sat like one family round my hearth .
such were we upon earth, wondering aghast at the effects of pestilence .
the blue and troubled sea sped past the vessel, and was spread shoreless around: the sky was covered by a rack, which in its swift motion shewed how speedily she was borne away .
my dear sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew . ''
there is no more painful sight than that of untimely care in children, and it was particularly observable in one whose disposition had heretofore been mirthful .
a presentiment of ill hung over her .
two soldiers contended for a girl, whose rich dress and extreme beauty excited the brutal appetites of these wretches, who, perhaps good men among their families, were changed by the fury of the moment into incarnated evils .
but i was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and accordingly i told clerval that i wished to make the tour of scotland alone .
be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock .
for the will of man is omnipotent, blunting the arrows of death, soothing the bed of disease, and wiping away the tears of agony .
at that moment i heard the steps of my younger protectors .
chapter day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to geneva; and i could not collect the courage to recommence my work .
she could not disguise to herself that any change would separate her from him; now she saw him each day .
raymond would follow soon, she said; he had been detained by business .
when i reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation .
i awoke from disturbed dreams .
perdita 's mind was not softened by this account .
he approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes .
about this time we retired to our house at belrive .
all was again silent, but his words rang in my ears .
close to the spot on which we stood, was a solitary rock, high and conical, which, divided on every side from the mountain, seemed a nature hewn pyramid; with little labour this block was reduced to a perfect shape; the narrow cell was scooped out beneath in which raymond was placed, and a short inscription, carved in the living stone, recorded the name of its tenant, the cause and aera of his death .
the poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance .
i entered its gloomy walls in a fit of triumphant extasy:  ''he feels me now, '' i cried,  ''and shall, again and again '' i passed but one day in confinement; in the evening i was liberated, as i was told, by the order of the earl himself .
yet a whole life of falsehood was otherwise my portion: and when remorse at being the contriver of any cheat made me shrink from my design i was irresistably led back and confirmed in it by the visit of some aunt or cousin, who would tell me that death was the end of all men .
no office, no devotion, no watching was irksome to her, as it regarded him .
a sister of my father was with him at this period .
it was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before .
this i most earnestly entreat, and i know you will comply . ''
i do not intend to hurt you; listen to me  . '  ''he struggled violently.
their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold .
the unexampled loveliness of the flower clad earth the genial sunshine and grateful shade the melody of the birds the majesty of the woods the splendour of the marble ruins the clear effulgence of the stars by night the combination of all that was exciting and voluptuous in this transcending land, by inspiring a quicker spirit of life and an added sensitiveness to every articulation of her frame, only gave edge to the poignancy of her grief .
this was a new sight to me, and i examined the structure with great curiosity .
ah if you knew what i have suffered and what i may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy . ''
i spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing .
again in vengeance of his wrath he falls on their great hosts, and breaks their tottering walls; arrests their navies on the ocean 's plain, and whelms their strength with mountains of the main .
adrian it is true had already gone to seek the fugitive, imagining that her tameless anxiety had led her to the purlieus of the house, and that some sinister event detained her .
such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day .
and now let the reader, passing over some short period of time, be introduced to our happy circle .
he made her warm offers of service; she was too much occupied by more engrossing thoughts, either to accept or reject them; at length he left her, making a promise to repeat his visit the next day .
the blood of my forefathers cries aloud in my veins, and bids me be first among my countrymen .
the wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me .
it contained but two rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury .
would that i had been indeed extinguished  ''and now, mathilda i must make you my last confession .
fear overcame me; i dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although i was unable to define them .
the course of the rhine below mainz becomes much more picturesque .
she soon went to pieces; i was shewn where she had been, and saw her disjoined timbers tossed on the waves .
i imagined, that it was my imperative duty to take her from scenes that thus forcibly reminded her of her loss .
mine has been a tale of horrors; i have reached their acme, and what i must now relate can but be tedious to you .
the district which contained them appeared the abode of every kindly spirit .
heavy falls of snow gave an arctic appearance to the scenery; the roofs of the houses peeped from the white mass; the lowly cot and stately mansion, alike deserted, were blocked up, their thresholds uncleared; the windows were broken by the hail, while the prevalence of a north east wind rendered out door exertions extremely painful .
do not turn from me; i do not ask you to reveal it: i only entreat you to listen to me and to become familiar with the voice of consolation and kindness .
adrian 's countenance flitted across, tainted by death idris, with eyes languidly closed and livid lips, was about to slide into the wide grave .
i i alone was the cause of his defeat and justly did i pay the fearful penalty .
i gasped for breath  ''i will not detail to you, '' continued raymond,  ''the melancholy particulars .
i forgot the distance between us:  ''i will go with thee, raymond '' i cried; but, my eye removed from the glass, i could scarce discern the pigmy forms of the crowd, which about a mile from me surrounded the gate; the form of raymond was lost .
i am not yet fallen so low; my honour is not yet so tarnished .
the thought was fleeting; for his attention was instantly drawn towards the inhabitant of this wretched abode .
but there was a fearlessness and frankness about her, which said that she would not encroach on another 's liberty, but held her own sacred and unassailable .
august , yesterday the stranger said to me,  ''you may easily perceive, captain walton, that i have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes .
on a sudden i heard a gentle step ascending the stairs; i paused breathless, and as it approached glided into an obscure corner of the room; the steps paused at my door, but after a few moments they again receeded, descended the stairs and i heard no more .
i entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves .
the merriment of the hour was an unholy mockery of the sorrows of man .
if, on the contrary, they are proof against expostulation, this very steadiness is an omen of success; and it becomes the duty of those who love them, to assist in smoothing the obstructions in their path .
i then paused, and a cold shivering came over me .
the few ineffectual words he had said concerning his duty were to me a further proof and the more i studied the letter the more did i perceive a thousand slight expressions that could only indicate a knowledge that life was now over for him .
in italy the rivers were unwatched by the diminished peasantry; and, like wild beasts from their lair when the hunters and dogs are afar, did tiber, arno, and po, rush upon and destroy the fertility of the plains .
even to us he assumed gaiety and hope, and assumed them so well, that we did not divine the secret workings of his mind .
good god in what desert land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient?
i avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch i had created .
in the autumn of this year , the spirit of emigration crept in among the few survivors, who, congregating from various parts of england, met in london .
she drifted towards the harbour, and was stranded on the sands at the entrance .
her eyes glistened with tears when she thanked me, and the grace of her expressions was enhanced, not diminished, by the fervour, which caused her almost to falter as she spoke .
the revenue of its possessor, which had always found a mode of expenditure congenial to his generous nature, was now attended to more parsimoniously, that it might embrace a wider portion of utility .
the modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles .
nay, henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe .
i listened to this discourse with the extremest agony .
who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee?
unwonted silence reigned in the house, the members spoke in whispers, and the ordinary business was transacted with celerity and quietness .
will you commune less with his departed spirit, while you watch over and cultivate the rare excellence of his child?
perdita listened to me impatiently, and answered with some asperity:  ''do you think that any of your arguments are new to me? or that my own burning wishes and intense anguish have not suggested them all a thousand times, with far more eagerness and subtlety than you can put into them?
the image of clerval was forever before me, ghastly and murdered .
it was a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence .
still perdita would expect him; he wrote a few incoherent words on a scrap of paper, testifying that he was well, and bade the woman of the house take it to the palace, and deliver it into the hands of the wife of the lord protector .
i wept for a long time untill i saw him about to revive, when horror and misery again recurred, and the tide of my sensations rolled back to their former channel: with a terror i could not restrain i sprung up and fled, with winged speed, along the paths of the wood and across the fields untill nearly dead i reached our house and just ordering the servants to seek my father at the spot i indicated, i shut myself up in my own room .
organs of articulate sound did not proclaim the union of our hearts; for untoward circumstance allowed no opportunity for the expression that hovered on our lips .
i had several times seen him ride across the heath and felt angry that my solitude should be disturbed .
woodville was free from all these evils; and if slight examples did come across him he did not notice them but passed on in his course as an angel with winged feet might glide along the earth unimpeded by all those little obstacles over which we of earthly origin stumble .
when i had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, i thought of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay .
we attempted to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted .
on perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in english, although with a foreign accent .
 ''good god he is gone but tell how this was; speak quick '' her relation was short .
 ''have you, then, some other attachment? ''  ''none on earth .
besides, i found that my understanding improved so much with every day 's experience that i was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity .
he often left perdita, to wander in the grounds alone; or in a light shallop he floated idly on the pure waters, musing deeply .
idris must not see him in this state .
the horse then galopped swiftly across the heath and the stranger remained on the ground stunned by his fall .
the change of scene operated to a great degree as i expected; after a year 's absence, perdita returned in gentler and more docile mood to windsor .
here aloft, the companions of the swift winged birds, we skim through the unresisting element, fleetly and fearlessly .
aye, i might die my soul with falsehood untill i had quite hid its native colour .
presently i heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door opened, and the wretch whom i dreaded appeared .
they were formed for one another and they soon loved .
i was not angry on my own account, but i felt as if the praises which this idol received were leaves torn from laurels destined for adrian .
could we domesticate a cub of this wild beast, and not fear its growth and maturity?
are you to be happy while i grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness?
yet when i effected my purpose, all i could discern within the precincts of the massive walls was a city of fire: the open way through which raymond had ridden was enveloped in smoke and flame .
he did not raise his, but after a short silence he replied to me in a low voice:  ''you are indeed presumptuous, mathilda, presumptuous and very rash .
assuredly he had not conned his lesson; and at first he hesitated, pausing in his ideas, and in the choice of his expressions .
in the south, the disease, virulent and immedicable, had nearly annihilated the race of man; storm and inundation, poisonous winds and blights, filled up the measure of suffering .
at the battle of makri he had led the charge of cavalry, and pursued the fugitives even to the banks of the hebrus .
but it was not so, i was yet young, oh far too young, nor was he dead to others; but i, most miserable, must never see or speak to him again .
i had wandered towards bracknel, far to the west of windsor .
he said this in his most gay, yet benevolent manner, and smiled, not disdainfully, but in playful mockery of himself .
he had introduced himself to adrian, by a request he made to observe some planetary motions from his glass .
i had visited it frequently during my boyhood .
saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in my sentiments .
there was so much intelligence combined with innocence, sensibility with forbearance, and seriousness with perfect good humour, a beauty so transcendant, united to such endearing simplicity, that she hung like a pearl in the shrine of our possessions, a treasure of wonder and excellence .
england, late birth place of excellence and school of the wise, thy children are gone, thy glory faded thou, england, wert the triumph of man small favour was shewn thee by thy creator, thou isle of the north; a ragged canvas naturally, painted by man with alien colours; but the hues he gave are faded, never more to be renewed .
one only return did he owe me, even fidelity .
still his mother did not despair .
this was not universal .
the spirit of superstition had birth, from the wreck of our hopes, and antics wild and dangerous were played on the great theatre, while the remaining particle of futurity dwindled into a point in the eyes of the prognosticators .
i must not be trifled with, and i demand an answer .
in our happiest days, perdita had adorned her cottage with every aid art might bring, to that which nature had selected to favour .
 ''justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and i recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one glance from justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that ariosto gives concerning the beauty of angelica she looked so frank hearted and happy .
we still had some attendants spared by disease, and warmly attached to us .
i saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilized man .
the forest glades, the ferny dells, and lawny uplands, the cultivated and cheerful country spread around the silver pathway of ancient thames, all earth, air, and wave, took up one choral voice, inspired by memory, instinct with plaintive regret .
but now, as soon as the horses arrived, i hurried into a cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend .
but this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which i had been progressively led to it were obliterated, and i beheld only the result .
the moon i gazed with a kind of wonder .
on the th of december of that year, my companion and i crossed the bay, to visit the antiquities which are scattered on the shores of baiae .
the natural clinging of the human mind to life and joy was in its full energy in her young heart; she gave herself impetuously up to the enchantment: they were married; and in their radiant features i saw incarnate, for the last time, the spirit of love, of rapturous sympathy, which once had been the life of the world .
evadne was two years older than adrian; and who, at eighteen, ever loved one so much their junior?
poor girl she wept when she quitted our house; she was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity .
they went to the river to break the ice, and draw water: they assembled on foraging expeditions, or axe in hand felled the trees for fuel .
all i can say is, that it is so .
among a race of independent, and generous, and well educated men, in a country where the imagination is empress of men 's minds, there needs be no fear that we should want a perpetual succession of the high born and lordly .
i renounced it to gain no matter what for that also i have lost .
the words of his letter by which he had dissuaded me from this step were those that determined me .
 ''william is dead that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay victor, he is murdered  ''i will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction .
the gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, i felt depressed; when they rejoiced, i sympathized in their joys .
 ''we cannot hope to live so long in our names as some have done in their persons; one face of janus holds no proportion to the other . ''
were not the mightiest men of the olden times kings?
perhaps there was besides a lurking dislike to bind herself in the face of the world to one whom she did not love not love, at least, with that passionate enthusiasm which her heart told her she might one day feel towards another .
sometimes, indeed, i dreamt that i wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth, but i awoke and found myself in a dungeon .
i smiled incredulously, and replied:   ''i am of ryland's way of thinking, and will, if you please, repeat all his arguments; we shall see how far you will be induced by them, to change the royal for the patriotic style . ''
even if they were to leave europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the daemon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror .
i saw him too; he was free last night ''  ''i do not know what you mean, '' replied my brother, in accents of wonder,  ''but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery .
frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the cause of the tumult .
i formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of me .
one thing you must promise, not to speak to any one but your uncle, of the conversation you have just overheard .
he had carried off their store of winter food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of the horror struck villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal frosts .
i administered the fitting remedies, and left my sweet niece to watch beside him, and bring me notice of any change she should observe .
if she were to continue inflexible in the line of conduct she now pursued, they must part .
how strange, i thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects i examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood .
for my hope who shall see it?
there can be no community between you and me; we are enemies .
i was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate .
she encouraged his craving for knowledge and his impetuous courage; she even tolerated his tameless love of freedom, under the hope that this would, as is too often the case, lead to a passion for command .
at first the increase of sickness in spring brought increase of toil to such of us, who, as yet spared to life, bestowed our time and thoughts on our fellow creatures .
meanwhile her active fancy wove a thousand combinations; she dreamt  ''of moving accidents by flood and field '' she lost herself delightedly in these self created wanderings, and returned with unwilling spirit to the dull detail of common life .
shutting the door, he approached me and said in a smothered voice,  ''you have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you intend?
he sent even to italy and greece for drawings; but, as the design was to be characterized by originality as well as by perfect beauty, his endeavours were for a time without avail .
shall i meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of africa or america?
the air resounded with their shouts; their picturesque costume, and the gay colours of which it was composed, flaunted in the sunshine; their eager gestures and rapid utterance accorded with their wild appearance .
at this period the name and exploits of one of my countrymen filled the world with admiration .
guided by a slight clue, i followed the windings of the rhone, but vainly .
there was so much of truth and nature in his resentment, that her doubts were dispelled .
alas he is cold, he cannot answer me . ''
what can i say? if you refuse to aid me, i am lost indeed '' she cast up her eyes, while wonder held her auditors mute; then, as if carried away by her feelings, she cried  ''my brother beloved, ill fated adrian how speak of your misfortunes?
however, it was hardly morning, and i might reasonably hope to arrive by night .
it seems as if the giant waves of ocean, and vast arms of the sea, were about to wrench the deep rooted island from its centre; and cast it, a ruin and a wreck, upon the fields of the atlantic .
the disposition of idris was peculiarly frank, soft, and affectionate .
i remained for several years their only child .
after the lapse of more than a year, adrian returned from greece .
thus perhaps as the sensation of immediate suffering wore off, i became more human .
it was a curious fact, that at this period, when by the marriage of perdita i was allied to one of the richest individuals in england, and was bound by the most intimate friendship to its chiefest noble, i experienced the greatest excess of poverty that i had ever known .
he was all gaiety; scraps of songs fell from his lips; every thought of his mind every object about us, gleamed under the sunshine of his mirth .
the body of the man who had landed, had been buried deep in the sands; and none could tell more, than that the vessel was american built, and that several months before the fortunatas had sailed from philadelphia, of which no tidings were afterwards received .
each long hour was counted, and  ''he suffers '' was the burthen of all her thoughts .
i would not disturb you at this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a conversation that i had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet .
my father was one of those men on whom nature had bestowed to prodigality the envied gifts of wit and imagination, and then left his bark of life to be impelled by these winds, without adding reason as the rudder, or judgment as the pilot for the voyage .
not so with us, the remnant .
 ''justine moritz poor, poor girl, is she the accused?
many of our visitors left us: those whose homes were far in the south, fled delightedly from our northern winter, and sought their native land, secure of plenty even after their fearful visitation .
the last words of evadne were the seal upon the warrant of my death .
immense glaciers approached the road; i heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage .
fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which i had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of paradise lost, a volume of plutarch 's lives, and the sorrows of werter .
in a moment however she revived, and, with energy, almost with violence, entreated me to saddle horses, to take her away, away to london to her brother at least to save her .
the wind, favourable to him, blew so strongly in shore, that we were unable, as we had at first intended, to meet him on his watery road .
the thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness .
the pain inflicted by this disappointment was tormenting and keen .
 ''you are in the wrong, '' replied the fiend;  ''and instead of threatening, i am content to reason with you .
 ''she was '', he said,  ''the brightest vision that ever came upon the earth: there was somthing in her frank countenance, in her voice, and in every motion of her graceful form that overpowered me, as if it were a celestial creature that deigned to mingle with me in intercourse more sweet than man had ever before enjoyed .
i afterwards learned that, knowing my father 's advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder .
farewell, my dear, excellent margaret .
my aunt was only relieved of her anxiety concerning his fate by a letter from him dated hamburgh .
oh, this was a delicious life quite void of guile i with my dove  's look and fox's heart: for indeed i felt only the degradation of falsehood, and not any sacred sentiment of conscious innocence that might redeem it .
it was part of the ex queen 's plan, to surround her son with princely magnificence .
 ''my dear father, you are mistaken; justine is innocent . ''
for myself, there was one reward i promised myself from my detested toils one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, i might claim elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her .
with the declining heat of a september night, a whirlwind of storm, thunder, and hail, rattled round the house, and with ghastly harmony sung the dirge of her family .
he heartily despised himself, he was angry with perdita, and the idea of evadne was attended by all that was hideous and cruel .
i looked back to my restless desires and painful struggles with my fellow beings as to a troubled dream, and felt myself as much changed as if i had transmigrated into another form, whose fresh sensorium and mechanism of nerves had altered the reflection of the apparent universe in the mirror of mind .
take me mould me to your will, possess my heart and soul to all eternity .
she neglected even her child; shutting her heart against all tenderness, she grew reserved towards me, her first and fast friend .
for a moment i could yield to the creative power of the imagination, and for a moment was soothed by the sublime fictions it presented to me .
i would not yield, but to the last gasp resolutely defended my dear ones against sorrow and pain; and if i were vanquished at last, it should not be ingloriously .
her intrigues with russia for the furtherance of her object, excited the jealousy of the porte, and the animosity of the greek government .
it was madness i believe, but i so worked myself up to this idea that i could think of nothing else .
urged by this view, i refused, and i did right in refusing, to create a companion for the first creature .
the air is empoisoned, and each human being inhales death, even while in youth and health, their hopes are in the flower .
wretched devil you reproach me with your creation, come on, then, that i may extinguish the spark which i so negligently bestowed . ''
she was for a while the sole object of his reveries; and perdita became aware that his thoughts and time were bestowed on a subject unparticipated by her .
the physical state of man would soon not yield to the beatitude of angels; disease was to be banished; labour lightened of its heaviest burden .
my own heart was racked by regrets and remorse .
a short conversation passed between us, but the next day he again stopped at my cottage and by degrees an intimacy grew between us .
 ''yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions .
for the first time in my life i envied the sleep of the dead, and thought with pleasure of one 's bed under the sod, where grief and fear have no power .
i was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth .
so that when we make our hearts a lair for that gently seeming beast, its companion enters with it, and pitilessly lays waste what might have been an home and a shelter . ''
now i was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel houses .
this idea was torture to him .
if you will comply with my conditions, i will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, i will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends . ''
our numbers were to move forward in separate parties, and to go by different routes, all to unite at last at paris .
raymond, the deliverer of greece, the graceful soldier, who bore in his mien a tinge of all that, peculiar to her native clime, evadne cherished as most dear raymond was loved by evadne .
and now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life .
if my last combat is now about to be fought, and i am to be worsted so let it be ''  ''but come, ryland, recollect yourself men have hitherto thought you magnanimous and wise, will you cast aside these titles?
i was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of jura .
they shall go down together to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust yes my hope was corruption and dust and all to which death brings us .
thou and nature are still true to me .
at length the rooms began to thin .
at length we arrived at a large, desert, dark cavern, which the lazzeroni assured us was the sibyl 's cave .
readiness of talent, a capacity of entering into, and leading the dispositions of men; earnest desire of distinction were the awakeners and nurses of his ambition .
expectation, and hopes, and affection were all too much for me .
with such schooling did my poor idris try to hush thronging fears, and in some measure succeeded .
i do not address them to you alone because it will give me pleasure to dwell upon our friendship in a way that would be needless if you alone read what i shall write .
live stock diminished sensibly in the country, from the effects of the great demand in the market .
at length i gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion .
the moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise .
how in poor assemblage of words convey the halo of glory that surrounded her, the thousand graces that waited unwearied on her .
you may easily imagine that i was much gratified by the offered communication, yet i could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes .
she started wildly from her couch, and flew to the cabin window .
i believe it was that coming out with a determination not to be repulsed i went right forward to my object without well weighing his replies: i was led by passion and drew him with frantic heedlessness into the abyss that he so fearfully avoided i replied to his terrific words:  ''you fill me with affright it is true, dearest father, but you only confirm my resolution to put an end to this state of doubt .
i grew impatient, i wept; sic and wrung my hands but still i could not discover my path .
she had read no novels and associated only with her younger sisters, what could she know of the difference between love and friendship?
there is no fruition in their vacant kindness, and sharp rocks lurk beneath the smiling ripples of these shallow waters .
he played a sweet mournful air which i perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet .
we were about to return homewards, when a voice, a human voice, strange now to hear, attracted our attention .
a few men came to aid him; their numbers increased; under their united blows the obstacle was vanquished, gate, portcullis, and fence were demolished; and the wide sun lit way, leading to the heart of the city, now lay open before them .
as the rules of order and pressure of laws were lost, some began with hesitation and wonder to transgress the accustomed uses of society .
we passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw mont saleve, the pleasant banks of montalegre, and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful mont blanc and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it .
my dream recurred to my thoughts; i was not usually superstitious but in wretchedness every one is so .
the aspect of the country had so far changed, that it had been impossible to enter on the task of sowing seed, and other autumnal labours .
then came the tale of hair breadth escapes, combats with dogs, ambush and flight, as gipsey like we encompassed our pot .
i cannot live the object of suspicion you cannot believe me let us part ''  ''exactly so, '' cried perdita,  ''i knew that it would come to this are we not already parted?
he wished to repay the kindness of the athenians, to keep alive the splendid associations connected with his name, and to eradicate from europe a power which, while every other nation advanced in civilization, stood still, a monument of antique barbarism .
you may see him his hair stuck with wild flowers his eyes full of untraceable meaning his voice broken his person wasted to a shadow .
during the first months of his protectorate, raymond and she had been inseparable; each project was discussed with her, each plan approved by her .
he asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy .
 ''come, '' said raymond,  ''i yielded to you yesterday, now comply with my request take the pencil . ''
her guardian was not displeased with their mutual affection: the merit of woodville was too eminent to admit of cavil on account of his inferior wealth; but the dying will of her father did not allow her to marry before she was of age and her fortune depended upon her obeying this injunction .
the very danger drew them closer .
the myrtle bushes, the thyme, the little cyclamen, which peep from the fissures of the rock, all the produce of the place, bear affinity to him; the light that invests the hills participates in his essence, and sky and mountains, sea and valley, are imbued by the presence of his spirit .
 ''she most of all, '' said ernest,  ''requires consolation; she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched .
he was not at the palace; and, though the attendants did not know whither he had gone, they did not expect him till late at night .
ever after this, i thought, i would live in the most dreary seclusion .
besides, is it not a shame, that the genius of adrian should fade from the earth like a flower in an untrod mountain path, fruitless?
 ''i do know you better, '' i replied  ''than to think that you would be happy in such a situation; but the good you would do to others may be an inducement, since the time is probably arrived when you can put your theories into practice, and you may bring about such reformation and change, as will conduce to that perfect system of government which you delight to portray . ''
i will live and die here  ''go you to england, lionel; return to sweet idris and dearest adrian; return, and let my orphan girl be as a child of your own in your house .
when his children had departed, he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more sweet and mournful than i had ever heard him play before .
many saw, seated above his vice regal throne, a supreme providence, who directed his shafts, and guided his progress, and they bowed their heads in resignation, or at least in obedience .
my cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had become emaciated with confinement .
the appearance of the plain was changed during this short interval; the encampment was broken up; the relics of the disbanded army met in small companies here and there; each face was clouded; every gesture spoke astonishment and dismay .
here i hold communion only with the has been, and to come .
justine, whom i loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?
he spoke with a broken voice, then bowed his head, and, hiding his face in his hands, wept .
he recognised the hand writing of evadne, and the colour mounted in his cheeks .
i was already well acquainted with what i may term the panorama of nature, the change of seasons, and the various appearances of heaven and earth .
how ill you are what is the cause of all this? ''  ''do not ask me, '' cried i, putting my hands before my eyes, for i thought i saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room;  ''he can tell .
but the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and on my return i met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart .
alas i am a most unhappy creature '' i was breathless with emotion, and i paused fixing my earnest eyes on my father, after i had dashed away the intrusive tears that dimmed them .
she was lovely; her manners were frank and simple; her deep blue eyes swam in a lustre which could only be given by sensibility joined to wisdom .
she herself wept as elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer .
in the mean time, while i thus pampered myself with rich mental repasts, a peasant would have disdained my scanty fare, which i sometimes robbed from the squirrels of the forest .
we visited the north of england, my native ulswater, and lingered in scenes dear from a thousand associations .
it was necessary that i should return without delay to geneva, there to watch over the lives of those i so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to blast me by his presence, i might, with unfailing aim, put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which i had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous .
  ''you have learnt a pretty lesson, perdita, '' said i,  ''and repeat it so literally, that you forget the while the proofs we have of the earl's virtues; his generosity to us is manifest in our plenty, his bravery in the protection he affords us, his affability in the notice he takes of us .
i slept too undisturbed by dreams; and awoke refreshed to again enjoy my tranquil freedom .
m   . krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of m. waldman.
by day and night these thoughts pursued me .
i dared hardly consider you as my daughter; your beauty, artlessness and untaught wisdom seemed to belong to a higher order of beings; your voice breathed forth only words of love: if there was aught of earthly in you it was only what you derived from the beauty of the world; you seemed to have gained a grace from the mountain breezes the waterfalls and the lake; and this was all of earthly except your affections that you had; there was no dross, no bad feeling in the composition .
i felt as the sailor, who from the topmast first discovered the shore of america; and like him i hastened to tell my companions of my discoveries in unknown regions .
raymond felt no relief, received no pleasure from any show of heaven or earth .
this was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and i replied earnestly,  ''you are all mistaken; i know the murderer .
she was not her child, but the daughter of a milanese nobleman .
be you witnesses, '' and he took the star, insignia of office, from his breast, and threw it on the table .
yet, when i am dead, if he should appear, if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he shall not live swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes .
i left her, and soon heard that she slept soundly under the influence of the opiate i had administered .
for my own part, since adrian had first withdrawn me from my selvatic wilderness to his own paradise of order and beauty, i had been wedded to literature .
at the same time that he taught me by their means to subdue my own reckless and uncultured spirit, he opened to my view the living page of his own heart, and gave me to feel and understand its wondrous character .
i was led to london, and had to endure for some weeks cold looks, cold words and colder consolations: but i escaped; they tried to bind me with fetters that they thought silken, yet which weighed on me like iron, although i broke them more easily than a girth formed of a single straw and fled to freedom .
i wandered on, and the coming darkness made every trace indistinct by which i might be guided .
the mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved felix were not for me .
this account may be taken as a sample of my intercourse with lord raymond .
he dismissed his servants there, only telling them that he had a sudden call of business and that they were to obey me as their mistress untill his return .
my father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness .
and now, dear margaret, do i not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?
the appetite for admiration and small capacity for self controul which i inherited from my father, nursed by adversity, made me daring and reckless .
the interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion .
 ''they shout, '' i said,  ''because they will soon return to england  . ''  ''do you, then, really return? ''  ''alas yes; i cannot withstand their demands.
he would rather have died such a death, which will be recorded in history to endless time, than have lived to old age unknown, unhonoured .
there is my hope and my expectation; your 's are in this world; may they be fulfilled .
shame shame if the first magistrate of england be foremost to renounce his duties . ''
this was all accomplished even as i wished .
among his other advantages, lord raymond was supremely handsome; every one admired him; of women he was the idol .
the meal was quickly dispatched .
i began to study more; to sympathize more in the thoughts of others as expressed in books; to read history, and to lose my individuallity among the crowd that had existed before me .
methought i had been invited to timon  's last feast; i came with keen appetite, the covers were removed, the hot water sent up its unsatisfying steams, while i fled before the anger of the host, who assumed the form of raymond; while to my diseased fancy, the vessels hurled by him after me, were surcharged with fetid vapour, and my friend's shape, altered by a thousand distortions, expanded into a gigantic phantom, bearing on its brow the sign of pestilence .
from your lips first have i heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; i shall be forever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom i am on the point of meeting  .   '  '''may i know the names and residence of those friends?'  ''i paused.
in greece i had learnt to love him; his very waywardness, and self abandonment to the impulses of superstition, attached me to him doubly; it might be weakness, but it was the antipodes of all that was grovelling and selfish .
o blessed sleep often, when most miserable, i sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture .
immediately before me was the top kapou, the gate near which mahomet had made the breach by which he entered the city .
we had remained five months in london three of joy and two of sorrow .
she looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal .
this may seem madness to you, yet you also have pride and resolution; do not then wonder that my pride is tameless, my resolution unalterable . ''
this passion is detrimental to me, for you do not reflect that you are the cause of its excess .
the very heart and soul of raymond and perdita had mingled, even as two mountain brooks that join in their descent, and murmuring and sparkling flow over shining pebbles, beside starry flowers; but let one desert its primal course, or be dammed up by choaking obstruction, and the other shrinks in its altered banks .
each day, before dawn, we left our night  's encampment, and watched the shadows as they retreated from hill and valley, and the golden splendour of the sun's approach .
subscriptions were made for the emigrants, and merchants bankrupt by the failure of trade .
she had not even the same advantage as i in the recollection of her parents; she clung to me, her brother, as her only friend, but her alliance with me completed the distaste that her protectors felt for her; and every error was magnified by them into crimes .
for some time, the spirit of hilarity was kept up; but, at length, perdita receded from the piano, for raymond had joined in the trio of  ''taci ingiusto core, '' in don giovanni, whose arch entreaty was softened by him into tenderness, and thrilled her heart with memories of the changed past; it was the same voice, the same tone, the self same sounds and words, which often before she had received, as the homage of love to her no longer was it that; and this concord of sound with its dissonance of expression penetrated her with regret and despair .
i lay upon the grass surrounded by a darkness which not the slightest beam of light penetrated there was no sound for the deep night had laid to sleep the insects, the only creatures that lived on the lone spot where no tree or shrub could afford shelter to aught else there was a wondrous silence in the air that calmed my senses yet which enlivened my soul, my mind hurried from image to image and seemed to grasp an eternity .
the guides bring with them materials for renewing the light, but we had none our only resource was to return as we came .
even so was it with the army of greece .
on the eve of the third day i retired early to my room; i could not sleep but paced all night about my chamber and, as you may in scotland at midsummer, watched the crimson track of the sun as it almost skirted the northern horizon .
i was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh .
day after day passed while we discussed our projects for the evening, and each night was occupied by debates which offered no conclusion .
the effect of this scene of incantation communicated a portion of its power to that which followed .
 ''do not answer; i know all your objections, and will reply to them in order .
i do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule .
if i survive, and she be lost, i were far better dead .
if she died, where could there be found on record a murderer, whose cruel act might compare with his?
in reply, my sister requested me to accompany her the following evening to the tomb of raymond .
