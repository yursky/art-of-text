herbert west needed fresh bodies because his life work was the reanimation of the dead .
the farm like grounds extended back very deeply up the hill, almost to wheaton street .
his facial aspect, too, was remarkable for its maturity; for though he shared his mother  's and grandfather's chinlessness, his firm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression of his large, dark, almost latin eyes to give him an air of quasi adulthood and well nigh preternatural intelligence .

dr  . johnson, as i beheld him, was a full, pursy man, very ill drest, and of slovenly aspect.
i have indistinct recollections of a great storm some time after i reached the boat; at any rate, i know that i heard peals of thunder and other tones which nature utters only in her wildest moods .
there had seemed to be no one in the courtyard below, and i hoped there would be a chance to get away before the spreading of a general alarm .
nothing, however, occurred except some hill noises; and when the day came there were many who hoped that the new horror had gone as swiftly as it had come .
it was getting dark, and the ancient roofs and chimney pots outside looked very queer through the bull 's eye window panes .
again he seemed to be in the interior of a house an old house, apparently but the details and inhabitants were constantly changing, and he could never be certain of the faces or the furniture, or even of the room itself, since doors and windows seemed in just as great a state of flux as the more presumably mobile objects .
 ''and what about the window panes? ''  ''they were all gone .

ahead lay sparse grass and scrub blueberry bushes, and beyond them the naked rock of the crag and the thin peak of the dreaded grey cottage .
everyone seemed inclined to be silent now, as though holding a secret fear .

as i have said, it happened when we were in the medical school, where west had already made himself notorious through his wild theories on the nature of death and the possibility of overcoming it artificially .
a definite point among the stars had a claim on him and was calling him .

then the lean nith remarked that no one had seen the old man or his wife since the night the cats were away .
and as i looked, i beheld the head rise, the black, liquid, and deep sunken eyes open in terror, and the thin, shadowed lips part as if for a scream too frightful to be uttered .

his engagement broken, galpin moved east to begin life anew; but before long, appletonians heard of his dismissal in disgrace from new york university, where he had obtained an instructorship in english .
he had a narrow head, bulging, watery blue eyes that seemed never to wink, a flat nose, a receding forehead and chin, and singularly undeveloped ears .
only a very rare affliction, of course, could bring about such vast and radical anatomical changes in a single individual after maturity changes involving osseous factors as basic as the shape of the skull but then, even this aspect was no more baffling and unheard of than the visible features of the malady as a whole .

it was my last link with a chapter of life forever closed, and i valued it highly .
to me there was nothing grotesque in the bones and skeletons that strowed some of the stone crypts deep down among the foundations .
the thing cannot be described there is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order .
it was queer damnably queer and my uncle spoke almost sheepishly, as if half expecting not to be believed, when he declared that of the strange faces many had unmistakably borne the features of the harris family .
not any more does he long for the magic of farther hills, or sigh for secrets that peer like green reefs from a bottomless sea .
then, as i remained, paralysed with fear, he found his voice and in his dying breath screamed forth those words which have ever afterward haunted my days and my nights .
they never stopped swimmin            ' in an' aout o' the river from that cursed reef o' satan an' more an' more attic winders got a boarded up, an' more an' more noises was heerd in haouses as wa'n't s'posed to hev nobody in 'em    . . . .
at lawrence he had been prominent in the mock fraternity of  ''tappa tappa keg '', where he was the wildest and merriest of the wild and merry young roysterers; but this immature, collegiate frivolity did not satisfy him .

there were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to connecting rooms, and these i proceeded to fasten .
the professor had been stricken whilst returning from the newport boat; falling suddenly, as witnesses said, after having been jostled by a nautical looking negro who had come from one of the queer dark courts on the precipitous hillside which formed a short cut from the waterfront to the deceased 's home in williams street .
suddenly the wretch, animated with his last burst of strength, raised his hideous head from the damp and sunken pavement .

sheehan   's is the acknowledged centre to chicago's subterranean traffic in liquor and narcotics, and as such has a certain dignity which extends even to the unkempt attachés of the place; but there was until lately one who lay outside the pale of that dignity one who shared the squalor and filth, but not the importance, of sheehan's .

no recognised school of sculpture had animated this terrible object, yet centuries and even thousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish surface of unplaceable stone .
all in all, he became a disconcerting and even gruesome companion; yet in my gratitude for his healing i could not well abandon him to the strangers around him, and was careful to dust his room and attend to his needs each day, muffled in a heavy ulster which i bought especially for the purpose .
it was a lambent glow of this sort which always played about the old woman and the small furry thing in those lighter, sharper dreams which prefaced his plunge into unknown abysses, and the thought that a wakeful second person could see the dream luminance was utterly beyond sane harbourage .

when i heard the fears which had driven the people from kilderry i laughed as loudly as my friend had laughed, for these fears were of the vaguest, wildest, and most absurd character .
i had been, albeit without definite reason, instinctively on my guard and that was to my advantage in the new and real crisis, whatever it might turn out to be .
then with utter and horrifying suddenness we heard a frightful sound from below .

that scene itself must have corresponded to the sealed loft overhead, which had begun to attack his imagination so violently, but later impressions were faint and hazy .
it was plain that the owner had come home; but he had not come from the land, nor from any balloon or airship that could be imagined .
others thought and still think he 'd found an old pirate cache out on devil reef .
this is what i saw in the glass: a thin, dark man of medium stature attired in the clerical garb of the anglican church, apparently about thirty, and with rimless, steel bowed glasses glistening beneath a sallow, olive forehead of abnormal height .

as my uncle began slowly and grudgingly to unwrap the things he urged me not to be shocked by the strangeness and frequent hideousness of the designs .
as i looked, a subtle, curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion; and oddly enough, i found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression .
it is curious that although he differed so widely from the mass of hispanicised and tribal indians, romero gave not the least impression of caucasian blood .
the task seemed interminable, and i raged almost as violently as the hermit when i saw the hours slipping by in a breathless, foodless round of vain telephoning, and a hectic quest from place to place, hither and thither by subway and surface car .
who or what then, was my great great grandmother?
nor was any child to be born alive in that house for a century and a half .
then, as september approached, the clouds began to clear .
at times her screams became insupportable, and for long periods she would utter shrieking horrors which necessitated her son 's temporary residence with his cousin, peleg harris, in presbyterian lane near the new college building .
it was the pictorial carving, however, that did most to hold me spellbound .
the grave was not very deep, but fully as good as that of the previous specimen the thing which had risen of itself and uttered a sound .
the abysses were by no means vacant, being crowded with indescribably angled masses of alien hued substance, some of which appeared to be organic while others seemed inorganic .
past the churchyard, where there were no houses, i could see over the hill 's summit and watch the glimmer of stars on the harbour, though the town was invisible in the dark .
the tension on our part became very great .
you on earth have unwittingly felt its distant presence you who without knowing idly gave to its blinking beacon the name of algol, the daemon star .
again a furtive trying of a bolted connecting door, and again a receding creaking .
i was still alone, for as much as i feared the unknown horror i sought, there was more fear in the thought of telling anybody .

briden looked back and went mad, laughing shrilly as he kept on laughing at intervals till death found him one night in the cabin whilst johansen was wandering deliriously .
to this man iranon spoke, as to so many others:  ''canst thou tell me where i may find aira, the city of marble and beryl, where flows the hyaline nithra and where the falls of the tiny kra sing to verdant valleys and hills forested with yath trees? ''
in my childhood the shunned house was vacant, with barren, gnarled, and terrible old trees, long, queerly pale grass, and nightmarishly misshapen weeds in the high terraced yard where birds never lingered .
there were reasons why i would have been glad to let the war separate us; reasons why i found the practice of medicine and the companionship of west more and more irritating; but when he had gone to ottawa and through a colleague 's influence secured a medical commission as major, i could not resist the imperious persuasion of one determined that i should accompany him in my usual capacity .
geographically it lay about two miles northwest of the base of tempest mountain, and three miles from the oak girt mansion .

on his throat were the marks of murderous hands, and on his left ankle was a distressing rat bite .
thus was i left to ponder on myself as the only human creature within the great fortress, and in my utter solitude my mind began to cease its vain protest against the impending doom, to become almost reconciled to the fate which so many of my ancestors had met .
but even in this acute moment my chief horror was something apart from the immediate weakness of my defences .
trade fallin      ' off, mills losin' business even the new ones an' the best of our menfolks kilt a privateerin' in the war of or lost with the elizy brig an' the ranger snow both of 'em gilman venters .

and one, who led the way, was clad in a ghoulishly humped black coat and striped trousers, and had a man 's felt hat perched on the shapeless thing that answered for a head    . . . .
the event, under the circumstances, was tremendous; for in the existence of a subterranean space here, my mad theories had terrible confirmation .
gilman 's dreams consisted largely in plunges through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and bafflingly disordered sound; abysses whose material and gravitational properties, and whose relation to his own entity, he could not even begin to explain .
the insane yarn i had heard from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams, and i felt i must keep the image of his wild, watery eyes as far as possible from my imagination .
there was none of the exotic technique you see in sidney sime, none of the trans saturnian landscapes and lunar fungi that clark ashton smith uses to freeze the blood .

an   ' the smell was awful, like what it is araound wizard whateley's ol' haouse   . . .
on a certain rainy afternoon when this illusion seemed phenomenally strong, and when, in addition, i had fancied i glimpsed a kind of thin, yellowish, shimmering exhalation rising from the nitrous pattern toward the yawning fireplace, i spoke to my uncle about the matter .
accordingly i kept north along main to martin, then turning inland, crossing federal street safely north of the green, and entering the decayed patrician neighbourhood of northern broad, washington, lafayette, and adams streets .
in bolton the prevailing spirit of puritanism had outlawed the sport of boxing with the usual result .
yet where had the fellow got such an odd notion?
at night he would not be alone, nor would the company of a few persons calm him .
its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing, and it soon came to be the greatest influence on the town, replacing freemasonry altogether and taking up headquarters in the old masonic hall on new church green .
we both inserted the whole unopened wooden box, closed the door, and started the electricity .
his dreams were meanwhile increasing in vividness, and though shewing him none of the strange cities and incredible gardens of the old days, were assuming a definite cast whose purpose could not be mistaken .
now, as the baying of that dead, fleshless monstrosity grows louder and louder, and the stealthy whirring and flapping of those accursed web wings circles closer and closer, i shall seek with my revolver the oblivion which is my only refuge from the unnamed and unnamable .
dr  . west 's reanimated specimens were not meant for long existence or a large audience.
the old woman always appeared out of thin air near the corner where the downward slant met the inward slant .
but it was not in these vortices of complete alienage that he saw brown jenkin .
the open book lay flat between us, with the picture staring repulsively upward .
i motioned to him to continue, which he did with renewed signs of reluctance .
he was merely crass of fibre and function thoughtless, careless, and liquorish, as his easily avoidable accident proves, and without that modicum of imagination which holds the average citizen within certain limits fixed by taste .
what this meant, no one could quite be certain till later .
i was also sorry that i had no one with whom to converse .
what i saw unnerved me most surprisingly, considering its relative triviality .
i had entered the brush grown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odour again waxed dominant .
after that experience west had dropped his researches for some time; but as the zeal of the born scientist slowly returned, he again became importunate with the college faculty, pleading for the use of the dissecting room and of fresh human specimens for the work he regarded as so overwhelmingly important .
evidently the ticket agent had not exaggerated the dislike which local people bore toward innsmouth and its denizens .
then came the frenzied tones again:   ''carter, it's terrible monstrous unbelievable '' this time my voice did not fail me, and i poured into the transmitter a flood of excited questions .
and yet, as the members severally shook their heads and confessed defeat at the inspector 's problem, there was one man in that gathering who suspected a touch of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and writing, and who presently told with some diffidence of the odd trifle he knew .
and it was under a horned waning moon that i saw the city for the first time .
perhaps it is madness that is overtaking me yet perhaps a greater horror or a greater marvel is reaching out .
here, truly, was the apotheosis of the unnamable .
those who have watched the tall, lean, terrible old man in these peculiar conversations, do not watch him again .
west, young despite his marvellous scientific acquirements, had scant patience with good dr  . halsey and his erudite colleagues; and nursed an increasing resentment, coupled with a desire to prove his theories to these obtuse worthies in some striking and dramatic fashion.
some time before noon his physician, dr  . hartwell, called to see him and insisted that he cease work.
gilman could not be very clear about his reasons for this last assumption, but his haziness here was more than overbalanced by his clearness on other complex points .
the aspect of that ruin i cannot describe i must have been mad, for it seemed to rise majestic and undecayed, splendid and column cinctured, the flame reflecting marble of its entablature piercing the sky like the apex of a temple on a mountain top .
his own face was in shadow, and he wore a wide brimmed hat which somehow blended perfectly with the out of date cloak he affected; but i was subtly disquieted even before he addressed me .
it was an odd scene, and because i was strange to new england i had never known its like before .
it was a key a guide to certain gateways and transitions of which mystics have dreamed and whispered since the race was young, and which lead to freedoms and discoveries beyond the three dimensions and realms of life and matter that we know .
as the hour for its arrival drew near i noticed a general drift of the loungers to other places up the street, or to the ideal lunch across the square .
it seems to me rather merciful that i do not, for they were terrible studies, which i pursued more through reluctant fascination than through actual inclination .
all made o  ' squirmin' ropes    . . .
looking about, i saw that the ceiling was wet and dripping; the soaking apparently proceeding from a corner on the side toward the street .
one afternoon there was a discussion of possible freakish curvatures in space, and of theoretical points of approach or even contact between our part of the cosmos and various other regions as distant as the farthest stars or the trans galactic gulfs themselves or even as fabulously remote as the tentatively conceivable cosmic units beyond the whole einsteinian space time continuum .
certainly it sounds absurd to hear that a woman educated only in the rudiments of french often shouted for hours in a coarse and idiomatic form of that language, or that the same person, alone and guarded, complained wildly of a staring thing which bit and chewed at her .
men have felt the tears of the gods on white capped thurai, though they have thought it rain; and have heard the sighs of the gods in the plaintive dawn winds of lerion .
besides, the body would not be even approximately fresh the next night .
gilman mechanically attended classes that morning, but was wholly unable to fix his mind on his studies .

a paralysis of fear stifled all attempts to cry out .
then one night when the moon was full the travellers came to a mountain crest and looked down upon the myriad lights of oonai .
we expelled the bodies through the double hatches and were alone in the u  .
when, to agree with him, i said i was distrustful of the authenticity of ossian 's ms, mr  . johnson said:  ''that, sir, does not do your understanding particular credit; for what all the town is sensible of, is no great discovery for a grub street critick to make.
back bay isn   't boston it isn't anything yet, because it's had no time to pick up memories and attract local spirits .
especially was he afraid to be out of doors alone when the stars were shining, and if forced to this condition he would often glance furtively at the sky as if hunted by some monstrous thing therein .
as the afternoon advanced, it became increasingly difficult to see; and we heard the rumble of a thunderstorm gathering over tempest mountain .
my preference would be to avoid paine, since the fire station there might be open all night .
chords, vibrations, and harmonic ecstasies echoed passionately on every hand; while on my ravished sight burst the stupendous spectacle of ultimate beauty .
and the roof is of pure gold, set upon tall pillars of ruby and azure, and having such carven figures of gods and heroes that he who looks up to those heights seems to gaze upon the living olympus .
the place was avoided with doubled assiduousness, and invested with every whispered myth tradition could supply .
it seems that on that last hideous night joe had stooped to look at the crimson rat tracks which led from gilman 's couch to the nearby hole .
for without warning, in one of the small hours beyond midnight, all the ravages of the years and the storms and the worms came to a tremendous climax; and after the crash there was nothing left standing in the street save two ancient chimneys and part of a stout brick wall .
it was, the belgian averred, a most extraordinary object; an object quite beyond the power of a layman to classify .
i did not like the way he looked at healthy living bodies; and then there came a nightmarish session in the cellar laboratory when i learned that a certain specimen had been a living body when he secured it .
i said it at first and i say it still, and i never swerved an inch, either, when he shewed that  ''ghoul feeding '' .
whilst they strove to strip from life its embroidered robes of myth, and to shew in naked ugliness the foul thing that is reality, kuranes sought for beauty alone .
unwholesome recollections of things in the necronomicon and the black book welled up, and he found himself swaying to infandous rhythms said to pertain to the blackest ceremonies of the sabbat and to have an origin outside the time and space we comprehend .
all denied a part in the ritual murders, and averred that the killing had been done by black winged ones which had come to them from their immemorial meeting place in the haunted wood .
they were that kind the old lattice windows that went out of use before  .
the bones of the tiny paws, it is rumoured, imply prehensile characteristics more typical of a diminutive monkey than of a rat; while the small skull with its savage yellow fangs is of the utmost anomalousness, appearing from certain angles like a miniature, monstrously degraded parody of a human skull .
morbid art doesn 't shock me, and when a man has the genius pickman had i feel it an honour to know him, no matter what direction his work takes .
from those blurred and fragmentary memories we may infer much, yet prove little .
of my exact age, even down to days and hours, i kept a most careful record, for each movement of the pendulum of the massive clock in the library told off so much more of my doomed existence .
at first it told to me only the plain little tales of calm beaches and near ports, but with the years it grew more friendly and spoke of other things; of things more strange and more distant in space and in time .
now, he reflected, those nervous fears were being mirrored in his disordered dreams .
open up the gates to yog sothoth with the long chant that ye  'll find on page of the complete edition, an' then put a match to the prison .

my host now took my hand to draw me to one of the two windows on the long side of the malodorous room, and at the first touch of his ungloved fingers i turned cold .

yog sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate .
when exceptions did occur, they were mostly persons with no trace of aberrancy, like the old clerk at the hotel .

it was he who had given me all the information i had of tillinghast after i was repulsed in rage .
when gilman climbed up a ladder to the cobwebbed level loft above the rest of the attic he found vestiges of a bygone aperture tightly and heavily covered with ancient planking and secured by the stout wooden pegs common in colonial carpentry .
many were the waterfalls in their courses, and many were the lilied lakelets into which they expanded .
nor could i ever after see the world as i had known it .
in the deeper dreams everything was likewise more distinct, and gilman felt that the twilight abysses around him were those of the fourth dimension .
they talked of their illustrious tyrant, and of the splendour of his capital; and exulted in the glory of the statue which musides had wrought for him .

i neither knew nor cared whether my experience was insanity, dreaming, or magic; but was determined to gaze on brilliance and gaiety at any cost .
i stopped automatically, though lacking the brain to retreat .
the scenery, judged by any ordinary aesthetic canon, is more than commonly beautiful; yet there is no influx of artists or summer tourists .
he was wholly alone, and his first act was to walk to the balustrade and look dizzily down at the endless, cyclopean city almost two thousand feet below .
those who had lacked something lacked it no longer, yet did fear and hatred and ignorance still brood over the street; for many had stayed behind, and many strangers had come from distant places to the ancient houses .
this i perceived with unhealthy sharpness despite the fact that two of my other senses were violently assailed .

as the weeks passed, the playing grew wilder, whilst the old musician acquired an increasing haggardness and furtiveness pitiful to behold .
in short, both principle and policy demanded stern action; and i could not doubt but that publius scribonius, bearing in mind the dignity and obligations of the roman people, would adhere to his plan of despatching the cohort, me accompanying, despite such objections as balbutius and asellius speaking indeed more like provincials than romans might see fit to offer and multiply .

not far from the grey city of ib did the wandering tribes lay the first stones of sarnath, and at the beings of ib they marvelled greatly .

whilst barzai was shouting these things atal felt a spectral change in the air, as if the laws of earth were bowing to greater laws; for though the way was steeper than ever, the upward path was now grown fearsomely easy, and the bulging cliff proved scarce an obstacle when he reached it and slid perilously up its convex face .

the things we saw were very old and marvellous, or at least they seemed so in the few straggling rays of light by which i viewed them, and i shall never forget the tottering ionic columns and fluted pilasters and urn headed iron fence posts and flaring lintelled windows and decorative fanlights that appeared to grow quainter and stranger the deeper we advanced into this inexhaustible maze of unknown antiquity .

we often cast a beam around the ship, but saw only dolphins, swimming parallel to our own drifting course .
and, as i have implied, it was not of the dead man himself that i became afraid .
warped and bigoted with preconceived illusions of justice, freedom, and consistency, they cast off the old lore and the old ways with the old beliefs; nor ever stopped to think that that lore and those ways were the sole makers of their present thoughts and judgments, and the sole guides and standards in a meaningless universe without fixed aims or stable points of reference .

i have said that i awaked suddenly and in alarm .
but when the moon went over to the west and the still tide ebbed from the sullen shore, i saw in that light old spires that the waves almost uncovered, and white columns gay with festoons of green seaweed .
the place was far from any road, and in sight of no other house, yet precautions were none the less necessary; since rumours of strange lights, started by chance nocturnal roamers, would soon bring disaster on our enterprise .
there was nothing like a ladder in the tomb, and the coffin niches on the sides and rear which birch seldom took the trouble to use afforded no ascent to the space above the door .

what i did succeed in doing was to overhear the nocturnal playing of the dumb old man .
about , when wilbur was a boy of ten whose mind, voice, stature, and bearded face gave all the impressions of maturity, a second great siege of carpentry went on at the old house .

it had been an eldritch thing no wonder sensitive students shudder at the puritan age in massachusetts .
he would have descended and asked the way to ooth nargai had not a fearsome aurora sputtered up from some remote place beyond the horizon, shewing the ruin and antiquity of the city, and the stagnation of the reedy river, and the death lying upon that land, as it had lain since king kynaratholis came home from his conquests to find the vengeance of the gods .
the press cuttings, as i have intimated, touched on cases of panic, mania, and eccentricity during the given period .
they glistened bloated and green in the moonbeams, and seemed to gaze up at the fount of light .
my immediate actions were peculiar for such a situation, but it is only in tales that a man does the dramatic and foreseen thing .
here the dense growth of weeds and briers hindered me and cruelly tore my clothes, but i was none the less glad that they were there to give me concealment in case of peril .
there was talk of a complaint to the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals; but nothing ever came of it, since dunwich folk are never anxious to call the outside world 's attention to themselves .
we chose our house with the greatest care, seizing at last on a rather run down cottage near the end of pond street; five numbers from the closest neighbour, and separated from the local potter 's field by only a stretch of meadow land, bisected by a narrow neck of the rather dense forest which lies to the north .
i now visited the accursed place with increased frequency; studying the unwholesome vegetation of the garden, examining all the walls of the building, and poring over every inch of the earthen cellar floor .

i believe i did ridiculous things such as offering prayers to artemis, latona, demeter, persephone, and plouton .
they insisted that this was kingsport, and i could not deny it .
the newcomer was a thin, dark man of medium height attired in the clerical garb of the anglican church .
the smell of the sea took on ominous implications, and the silent driver 's bent, rigid back and narrow head became more and more hateful .

william harris, at last thoroughly convinced of the radically unhealthful nature of his abode, now took steps toward quitting it and closing it forever .
it wearied carter to see how solemnly people tried to make earthly reality out of old myths which every step of their boasted science confuted, and this misplaced seriousness killed the attachment he might have kept for the ancient creeds had they been content to offer the sonorous rites and emotional outlets in their true guise of ethereal fantasy .
i cannot express the wild, breathless suspense with which we waited for results on this first really fresh specimen the first we could reasonably expect to open its lips in rational speech, perhaps to tell of what it had seen beyond the unfathomable abyss .
he sometimes dreamed better when awake, and he wanted to use that key .

i had, i felt, been halted by a barrier which my friend and leader had successfully passed .
after the beams came clouds, and then i slept .
the villagers of hatheg say it is ill to climb hatheg kla at any time, and deadly to climb it by night when pale vapours hide the summit and the moon; but barzai heeded them not when he came from neighbouring ulthar with the young priest atal, who was his disciple .
apparently the horror had descended by a route much the same as that of its ascent .
relieved of my seizure in a marvellously short while, i left the shivery place a disciple and devotee of the gifted recluse .
only an effort halted him at a cafeteria in church street, and after the meal he felt the unknown pull still more strongly .
for some unknown reason i dreaded the thought of disturbing the ancient bog and its sunless secrets, and pictured terrible sights lying black under the unmeasured depth of age old peat .
on account of the general alarm and precautions, there were only two more victims, and the capture was effected without major casualties .
it was in the dark of september th that the horror broke loose .
there were vague statements about disease and concentration camps, and later about dispersal in various naval and military prisons, but nothing positive ever developed .
on reflection, he was glad he had not consulted the still more inquisitive college doctor .
barzai knew so much of the gods that he could tell of their comings and goings, and guessed so many of their secrets that he was deemed half a god himself .
others   'll worship with us at meetin' time, an' sarten haouses hez got to entertain guests    . . .
we did not descend far, and when after several hours the sea was calmer, we decided to return to the surface .
he had thought he heard rats in the partitions all the evening, but paid little attention to them .
it appeared that i was a provincial quæstor named l   . cælius rufus, and that i had been summoned by the proconsul, p. scribonius libo, who had come from tarraco some days before.
i admired his clearness and persistence, and added some further revelations i had collected among the old people .
   ''let me see, trever, '' continued the defaulter,  ''didn't schultz say your mother is a literary person, too? ''  ''yes, damn it, '' replied trever,  ''but nothing like the old teian she's one of those dull, eternal moralisers that try to take all the joy out of life .
the terror which brought me to the scene was a sudden and portentous confirmation of the mountaineers ' wildest legends .
on the third day slater was found unconscious in the hollow of a tree, and taken to the nearest gaol; where alienists from albany examined him as soon as his senses returned .
somewhere, to what remote and fearsome region i know not, denys barry has gone .
my mind, as alert as my senses, recognised the gravely unusual; and almost automatically i leaped up and turned about to grasp the destructive instruments which we had left trained on the mouldy spot before the fireplace .
that the influence of the old house was unwholesome, he could not deny; but traces of his early morbid interest still held him there .
they say there is no land of lomar, save in my nocturnal imaginings; that in those realms where the pole star shines high and red aldebaran crawls low around the horizon, there has been naught save ice and snow for thousands of years, and never a man save squat yellow creatures, blighted by the cold, whom they call  ''esquimaux '' .
degraded and ignorant as they were, the creatures held with surprising consistency to the central idea of their loathsome faith .
of the name and abode of this man but little is written, for they were of the waking world only; yet it is said that both were obscure .
some said the thunder called the lurking fear out of its habitation, while others said the thunder was its voice .
i hear a noise at the door, as of some immense slippery body lumbering against it .
his oddities certainly did not look asiatic, polynesian, levantine, or negroid, yet i could see why the people found him alien .
as i hurried home through those narrow, winding, mist choked waterfront streets i had a frightful impression of being stealthily followed by softly padding feet .
that at least two of the fear 's embodiments were destroyed, formed but a slight guarantee of mental and physical safety in this acheron of multiform diabolism; yet i continued my quest with even greater zeal as events and revelations became more monstrous .
it was not a strong or even a fairly strong light; certainly not nearly strong enough to read an average book by .
only his tendency toward a dazed stupor prevented him from screaming aloud .
i am an entity like that which you yourself become in the freedom of dreamless sleep .
it was more horrible than anything i had ever overheard, because i could now see the expression of his face, and could realise that this time the motive was stark fear .
he had heard, meanwhile, of whateley 's grotesque trip to cambridge, and of his frantic efforts to borrow or copy from the necronomicon at the widener library .
early risers on the th noticed a peculiar stench in the air .
in the midst of these reflections, as if dramatically arranged to intensify them, there fell near by a terrific bolt of lightning followed by the sound of sliding earth .
i hated the mocking moon, the hypocritical plain, the festering mountain, and those sinister mounds .
reading the life of theseus, i was much impressed by that passage telling of the great stone beneath which the boyish hero was to find his tokens of destiny whenever he should become old enough to lift its enormous weight .
those old ones were gone now, inside the earth and under the sea; but their dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to the first men, who formed a cult which had never died .
and there were cobblestones over which clattered many a blooded horse and rumbled many a gilded coach; and brick sidewalks with horse blocks and hitching posts .
the more he remembered of his hideous dream the more terrified he felt, and it added to his desperation to hear joe mazurewicz chanting mournfully two floors below .
sometimes he would take walks through shadowy tangles of unpaved musty smelling lanes where eldritch brown houses of unknown age leaned and tottered and leered mockingly through narrow, small paned windows .
i did, however, improve my stay in arkham by collecting some genealogical notes i had long wished to possess; very rough and hasty data, it is true, but capable of good use later on when i might have time to collate and codify them .
messrs  . ricci, czanek, and silva selected the night of april th for their call.
the rue d 'auseil lay across a dark river bordered by precipitous brick blear windowed warehouses and spanned by a ponderous bridge of dark stone .
when i see this i telled eb holt,        'that's suthin' ta stir ye up an' make yer blood tickle' when i read in scripter about slayin' like them midianites was slew i kinder think things, but i ain't got no picter of it .
the really inexplicable thing was the way in which the victims ignorant people, for the ill smelling and widely shunned house could now be rented to no others would babble maledictions in french, a language they could not possibly have studied to any extent .
i remember the night i made the five concentric circles of fire on the floor, and stood in the innermost one chanting that monstrous litany the messenger from tartary had brought .
meanwhile joyful servants were proclaiming the finding of young godfrey in a distant and unused chamber of the great edifice, telling too late that poor michel had been killed in vain .
and yet i saw them in a limitless stream flopping, hopping, croaking, bleating surging inhumanly through the spectral moonlight in a grotesque, malignant saraband of fantastic nightmare .
north of the river there were traces of squalid life active fish packing houses in water street, smoking chimneys and patched roofs here and there, occasional sounds from indeterminate sources, and infrequent shambling forms in the dismal streets and unpaved lanes but i seemed to find this even more oppressive than the southerly desertion .
the picture was very vivid for a while, but gradually gave way to a more horrible conception; that of utter, absolute solitude in infinite, sightless, soundless space .
the next day, it appears, they raised and landed on a small island, although none is known to exist in that part of the ocean; and six of the men somehow died ashore, though johansen is queerly reticent about this part of his story, and speaks only of their falling into a rock chasm .
only old zebulon, who was not with the group, could have done justice to the situation or suggested a plausible explanation .
they filed a ponderous report at the court house in aylesbury, and litigations concerning heirship are said to be still in progress amongst the innumerable whateleys, decayed and undecayed, of the upper miskatonic valley .
it was from these that i determined to choose a colleague, and the more i reflected the more my preference inclined toward one arthur munroe, a dark, lean man of about thirty five, whose education, taste, intelligence, and temperament all seemed to mark him as one not bound to conventional ideas and experiences .
but of what followed, and of the reason i was found alone and dazed on the edge of the swamp next morning, i must insist that i know nothing save what i have told you over and over again .
he would often awake calling for his mother and grandfather, both in their graves a quarter of a century .
i told them of the vault, and they pointed to the unbroken plaster wall and laughed .
at three o 'clock he took some lunch at a restaurant, noting meanwhile that the pull had either lessened or divided itself .
the whippoorwills were piping wildly, and in a singularly curious irregular rhythm quite unlike that of the visible ritual .
this fusion of dream and reality was too much to bear .
in she fell victim to a mild form of insanity, and was thereafter confined to the upper part of the house; her elder maiden sister, mercy dexter, having moved in to take charge of the family .
he talked of death incessantly, but laughed hollowly when such things as burial or funeral arrangements were gently suggested .
the villagers did not know how much to believe from so small a boy; and though they feared that the evil pair had charmed the cats to their death, they preferred not to chide the old cotter till they met him outside his dark and repellent yard .
it is still spectral, but its strangeness fascinates me, and i shall find mixed with my relief a queer regret when it is torn down to make way for a tawdry shop or vulgar apartment building .
reason, logic, and normal ideas of motivation stood confounded .
for three days they climbed higher, higher, and higher toward the roof of the world; then they camped to wait for the clouding of the moon .
aunt martha was in the doorway, and did not scold too hard when benijah shoved the truant in .
probably they traded in arkham, knowing how little kingsport liked their habitation, or perhaps being unable to climb down the cliff on the kingsport side .
rome and ravenna are rivals for the honour of his birth, though it is certain that he received his rhetorical and philosophical training in the schools of athens the extent of whose suppression by theodosius a century before is grossly exaggerated by the superficial .
men of learning suspect it little, and ignore it mostly .
of this he had been assured by frank elwood, the one fellow student whose poverty forced him to room in this squalid and unpopular house .
as the weeks passed, i observed with regret that my new friend was indeed slowly but unmistakably losing ground physically, as mrs  . herrero had suggested.
then, with a dazed automatism which persisted despite hopelessness, i made for the next connecting door and performed the blind motion of pushing at it in an effort to get through and granting that fastenings might be as providentially intact as in this second room bolt the hall door beyond before the lock could be turned from outside .
shall i say that the voice was deep; hollow; gelatinous; remote; unearthly; inhuman; disembodied?
he read avidly by himself now; but talked much less than formerly .
finally the air grew thin, and the sky changed colour, and the climbers found it hard to breathe; but still they toiled up and up, marvelling at the strangeness of the scene and thrilling at the thought of what would happen on the summit when the moon was out and the pale vapours spread around .
so taking the solitary acetylene lamp into the adjacent laboratory, we left our silent guest on the slab in the dark, and bent every energy to the mixing of a new solution; the weighing and measuring supervised by west with an almost fanatical care .
at last came that which i had long feared .
but before his resolution was put to the test, the unexpected intervened .
she had found it in the young gentleman 's bed on the side next the wall .
what was it that had enmeshed him?
many things had taught them secretiveness, and there was now no need to exert pressure on them .
though the hands of its clock were missing on the side i glimpsed, i knew that those hoarse strokes were telling the hour of eleven .
all of these, however, bore out the notes in full .
professor upham especially liked his demonstration of the kinship of higher mathematics to certain phases of magical lore transmitted down the ages from an ineffable antiquity human or pre human whose knowledge of the cosmos and its laws was greater than ours .
like and yet unlike, for there was in the eyes of all a weird, unhealthy glitter as of greed, ambition, vindictiveness, or misguided zeal .
to seek to describe it were useless for it was such that no description is possible .
 ''everybody was in a bad way them days .
here the strangers had been granted a haven; and the swarthy etienne roulet, less apt at agriculture than at reading queer books and drawing queer diagrams, was given a clerical post in the warehouse at pardon tillinghast 's wharf, far south in town street .
but still these shadows of my dream deride me .
one september day an unexpected glimpse of him induced an epileptic fit in a man who had come to repair his electric desk lamp; a fit for which he prescribed effectively whilst keeping himself well out of sight .
so without delay west had injected into the body 's wrist the compound which would hold it fresh for use after my arrival .
everybody shrieked when a large rat like form suddenly jumped out from beneath the ensanguined bedclothes and scuttled across the floor to a fresh, open hole close by .
it is perhaps worth mentioning that i was not at all surprised or terrified on learning of the nature of the vault .
then he saw the old woman and the small furry thing advancing toward him over the carpeted floor .
there was a suggestion of sound, too, though the wind was blowing the other way a suggestion of bestial scraping and bellowing even worse than the muttering of the parties i had lately overheard .
i, a german, should be the first to tread those aeon forgotten ways i produced and examined a deep sea diving suit of joined metal, and experimented with the portable light and air regenerator .
for the cat is cryptic, and close to strange things which men cannot see .
the far corners were all shadows, and the whole place took on a hazy unreality which obscured its nature and invited the imagination to symbolism and phantasm .
he was, in fine, made sensible that all the world is but the smoke of our intellects; past the bidding of the vulgar, but by the wise to be puffed out and drawn in like any cloud of prime virginia tobacco .
ironic humour dragged down all the twilight minarets he reared, and the earthy fear of improbability blasted all the delicate and amazing flowers in his faery gardens .
west and i were doing post graduate work in summer classes at the medical school of miskatonic university, and my friend had attained a wide notoriety because of his experiments leading toward the revivification of the dead .
honest, wholesome structures do not stare at travellers so slyly and hauntingly, and in my genealogical researches i had encountered legends of a century before which biassed me against places of this kind .
my eyes, however, never turned away from the horrible opening at the base of the chimney; and i began to get glimpses of the crumbling bricks and unhealthy weeds as faint glows of lightning penetrated the woods outside and illumined the chinks in the upper wall .
far into the night they discussed, and the next day was a whirlwind of preparation on the part of them all .
at the time, indeed, my attention was distracted from this matter by another phenomenon; a phenomenon so fleeting that i could not take oath upon its reality .
i climbed gentle hills from whose summits i could see entrancing panoramas of loveliness, with steepled towns nestling in verdant valleys, and with the golden domes of gigantic cities glittering on the infinitely distant horizon .
and on the thirty first day that we followed the bird, we beheld the basalt pillars of the west .
the marsh still glittered beyond, but in the farther distance i saw the steeples of what was then all of new york; trinity and st  . paul 's and the brick church dominating their sisters, and a faint haze of wood smoke hovering over the whole.
you say to me that there is nothing in the swamp or near it which could form the setting of that frightful episode .
the light was not white but violet, and seemed less like true light than like some radio active bombardment .
then there came a subdued sort of clatter which somehow set me all in gooseflesh a furtive, groping kind of clatter, though i can 't attempt to convey what i mean in words .
at last i could feel a real shiver run through manton, who had moved very near .
my programme, i decided, would be to thread the principal streets, talk with any non natives i might encounter, and catch the eight o 'clock coach for arkham .
always an ice cold intellectual machine; slight, blond, blue eyed, and spectacled; i think he secretly sneered at my occasional martial enthusiasms and censures of supine neutrality .
brown jenkin, tough of sinew and with four tiny hands of daemoniac dexterity, had been busy while the witch was throttling him, and his efforts had been in vain .
in this fearless explorer had been placed in a madhouse at huntingdon .
but the villagers did not discuss such things with the old man and his wife; because of the habitual expression on the withered faces of the two, and because their cottage was so small and so darkly hidden under spreading oaks at the back of a neglected yard .
as i stood pondering with my hand on the now useless switch i heard a muffled creaking on the floor below, and thought i could barely distinguish voices in conversation .
 ''oh, thet afriky book?
there it still stood on the night i dug in jan martense 's grave .
in the evening barry dined with me and announced that he would begin the drainage in two days .
as he listened he thought a rhythmic confusion of faint musical pipings covering a wide tonal range welled up from the narrow streets beneath, and he wished he might discern the denizens of the place .
his feet were indistinguishable because of the table and bench, but he must have been shod, since there was a clicking whenever he changed position .
all this, to the pious miss tilton, formed an excellent reason for shunning the ancient town of decay and desolation; but to me it was merely a fresh incentive .
just as the building was wiped out by a german shell, there had been a success .
and it was by moonlight that we anchored at last in the harbour of sona nyl, which is guarded by twin headlands of crystal that rise from the sea and meet in a resplendent arch .
on the floor were confused muddy prints, but oddly enough they did not extend all the way to the door .
alone i mounted the tower, for every man of stout body was needed in the passes below .
but as leaving time obviously approached i conquered my qualms and followed the man aboard, extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single word  ''innsmouth '' .
seized with a gloomy and fanatical belief which exiled them from their kind, their ancestors sought the wilderness for freedom .
in his dream delirium gilman heard the hellish, alien rhythmed chant of the sabbat coming from an infinite distance, and knew the black man must be there .
a struggle, a needle, and a powerful alkaloid had transformed it to a very fresh corpse, and the experiment had succeeded for a brief and memorable moment; but west had emerged with a soul calloused and seared, and a hardened eye which sometimes glanced with a kind of hideous and calculating appraisal at men of especially sensitive brain and especially vigorous physique .
the building was full of a frightful stench which dr  . armitage knew too well, and the three men rushed across the hall to the small genealogical reading room whence the low whining came.
but alfred trever did not speak the truth, as many guessed when he offered to take charge of the body and secure its interment in appleton .
before i had protested at his unnatural pryings into the unthinkable; now that he had evidently succeeded to some degree i almost shared his spirit, terrible though the cost of victory appeared .
he now refused to admit me at any time, and shunned me whenever we met on the stairs .
here we were comparatively calm, despite a somewhat puzzling southward current which we could not identify from our oceanographic charts .
i can see him now as he was then and i shiver .
from beyond came a glow that weirdly lit the giant twisted trees and the tops of the buried temples, and i drifted on songfully, expectant of the glories of the land from whence i should never return .
a very thin sprinkling of repellent looking youngish people now became visible on the sidewalks lone individuals, and silent knots of two or three .
but i might not be mad if those accursed tomb legions had not been so silent .
a couple o  ' weeks later, when nothin' had ben throwed into the sea fer that long   . . .
and yet i could extract nothing definite from the man .
even now he could detect a low, monstrous shaking whose tempo he suspected all too well .
upon that sea the hateful moon shone, and over its unvocal waves weird perfumes brooded .
and golden flames played about weedy locks, so that olney was dazzled as he did them homage .
it was to a time battered edifice of this description that i was driven one afternoon in november, , by a rain of such chilling copiousness that any shelter was preferable to exposure .
them as was born more like the things changed arly, but them as was nearly human sometimes stayed on the island till they was past seventy, though they 'd usually go daown under fer trial trips afore that .
as i considered the inevitable end my mind ran over preceding events, and developed a hitherto dormant impression which would have caused a weaker and more superstitious man to shudder .
and as i looked upon the little gate in the mighty wall, i felt that beyond it lay a dream country from which, once it was entered, there would be no return .
my uncle, it seems, had quickly instituted a prodigiously far flung body of inquiries amongst nearly all the friends whom he could question without impertinence, asking for nightly reports of their dreams, and the dates of any notable visions for some time past .
the deep ones could never be destroyed, even though the palaeogean magic of the forgotten old ones might sometimes check them .
he did not walk or climb, fly or swim, crawl or wriggle; yet always experienced a mode of motion partly voluntary and partly involuntary .
yet i had read only the least fragment of that blasphemous rune before closing the book and bringing it away .
sometimes, in the throes of a nightmare when unseen powers whirl one over the roofs of strange dead cities toward the grinning chasm of nis, it is a relief and even a delight to shriek wildly and throw oneself voluntarily along with the hideous vortex of dream doom into whatever bottomless gulf may yawn .
apparently it was a point somewhere between hydra and argo navis, and he knew that he had been urged toward it ever since he had awaked soon after dawn .
one other thing is curious .
louder and louder, wilder and wilder, mounted the shrieking and whining of that desperate viol .
having taken the fortified places at the foot of the mountains, their way now lay open to the plateau, unless every citizen could resist with the strength of ten men .
methought its spirit whispered evil counsel, soothing me to traitorous somnolence with a damnable rhythmical promise which it repeated over and over:   ''slumber, watcher, till the spheres six and twenty thousand years have revolv'd, and i return to the spot where now i burn .
one might easily imagine an alien nucleus of substance or energy, formless or otherwise, kept alive by imperceptible or immaterial subtractions from the life force or bodily tissues and fluids of other and more palpably living things into which it penetrates and with whose fabric it sometimes completely merges itself .
people sometimes heard the queerest kind of sounds .
the trail up and down sentinel hill seemed to armitage of almost cataclysmic significance, and he looked long at the sinister altar like stone on the summit .
for the moment his recollections were hopelessly hazy, but he knew at least that he must have been sleep walking .
i was not alone, for foolhardiness was not then mixed with that love of the grotesque and the terrible which has made my career a series of quests for strange horrors in literature and in life .
it was he who wisely advised the burgesses of ulthar when they passed their remarkable law against the slaying of cats, and who first told the young priest atal where it is that black cats go at midnight on st  . john 's eve.
in the spring after wilbur 's birth lavinia resumed her customary rambles in the hills, bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy child .
klenze had gone mad and perished before reaching this sinister remnant of a past unwholesomely remote, and had advised me to go with him .
wudn  't bother no strangers as might bear tales aoutside that is, withaout they got pryin' .
i wondered for a moment what the strange affliction of this man might be, and whether his obstinate refusal of outside aid were not the result of a rather baseless eccentricity .
but business is business, and to a robber whose soul is in his profession, there is a lure and a challenge about a very old and very feeble man who has no account at the bank, and who pays for his few necessities at the village store with spanish gold and silver minted two centuries ago .
he had not mentioned this before, but now he must tell about it because it meant that keziah and her long toothed familiar were haunting the young gentleman .
but it was lonely among strangers, so barry had asked me to come .
in the sunshine of the morning the proxenoi led the tyrant 's messengers up the slope to the abode of the sculptor, but the night wind had done strange things .
one case, which the note describes with emphasis, was very sad .
it was the terrible season of the autumn, and the wild people in the mountains were preparing for the frightful ceremonies which only rumour told of in the towns .
the first comer now went to a cupboard on the inner side of the room and extracted a coil of rope .
within twenty four hours the stranger had become so bright that it outshone capella .
from some farmhouse far away came the frantic barking of dogs .
he had been found covered with blood and shreds of flesh in a wood, shortly after the killing and rending of a boy by a pair of wolves .
i tried to raise my hand to shut out the sight, yet so stunned were my nerves that my arm could not fully obey my will .
and the mists of the dawn are thicker, and sailors are not quite so sure that all the muffled seaward ringing is that of the solemn buoys .
dangers he met unflinchingly; crimes he committed unmoved .
i had often heard of this work, with its curious illustrations by the brothers de bry, hence for a moment forgot my uneasiness in my desire to turn the pages before me .
at the end of the corridor was a bathroom a discouraging relique with ancient marble bowl, tin tub, faint electric light, and musty wooden panelling around all the plumbing fixtures .
morning came wanly, and the night sounds ceased .
and he gazed also upon mount aran rising regally from the shore, its lower slopes green with swaying trees and its white summit touching the sky .
i did not like those rumours of a fight which were floating about .
had i not a right to rest till eternity amongst the descendants of sir geoffrey hyde?
disintegration is quite painless, i assure you but i want you to see them .
before carter awaked, the gentle visitant had told him where to find that box; that carved oak box of archaic wonder whose grotesque lid no hand had raised for two centuries .
also, dombrowski must attend to the poisoning of those rats in the walls .
then i saw the lurid shimmering of pale light, and heard the insidious lapping of sunless waters .
this ancient confirmed every tale which jermyn had heard, adding his own account of the stone city and the white apes as it had been told to him .
sleep seized me quickly, and i was at once haunted with dreams of the most disturbing kind .
the patterns all hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable abysses in time and space, and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister .
one detail that annoyed me was the distribution of the few faint sounds i heard .
the change, it was said, came simultaneously with the innsmouth epidemic of , and was thought by simple folk to have a dark connexion with hidden forces of evil .
johansen and his men landed at a sloping mud bank on this monstrous acropolis, and clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which could have been no mortal staircase .
birch, being by temperament phlegmatic and practical, did not shout long; but proceeded to grope about for some tools which he recalled seeing in a corner of the tomb .
and the young men who had returned dwelt there no longer .
he must have been trapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss, or else the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy .
i watched from midnight to one o 'clock, when in spite of the sinister house, the unprotected window, and the approaching thunder and lightning, i felt singularly drowsy .
it faced south, with one gable end buried to the lower windows in the eastward rising hill, and the other exposed to the foundations toward the street .
maounds o   ' the dead an' the dyin'    . . .
in another second i was alone in the accursed mansion, shivering and gibbering .
ahead was the robed black man he had seen in the peaked space in the other dream, while from a lesser distance the old woman was beckoning and grimacing imperiously .
let us go to oonai, o iranon of the golden head, where men shall know our longings and welcome us as brothers, nor ever laugh or frown at what we say . ''
he paused exhausted, as the whole group of natives stared in a bewilderment not quite crystallised into fresh terror .
with the years the legends take on a spectral character i suppose the thing, if it was a living thing, must have died .
up the long drive rolled the coaches of the boston gentry, whilst on foot came a numerous assemblage of powdered exquisites from the neighbouring mansions .
the material seemed to be predominantly gold, though a weird lighter lustrousness hinted at some strange alloy with an equally beautiful and scarcely identifiable metal .
into the sunset wandered iranon, seeking still for his native land and for men who would understand and cherish his songs and dreams .
hasheesh helped a great deal, and once sent him to a part of space where form does not exist, but where glowing gases study the secrets of existence .
i seemed to know where i was, but cannot recall what i then knew .
i have said that i dwelt apart from the visible world, but i have not said that i dwelt alone .
these persons were not all cut off suddenly by any one cause; rather did it seem that their vitality was insidiously sapped, so that each one died the sooner from whatever tendency to weakness he may have naturally had .
his build and lower facial features were like other clergymen i had seen, but he had a vastly higher forehead, and was darker and more intelligent looking also more subtly and concealedly evil looking .
on another night kuranes walked up a damp stone spiral stairway endlessly, and came to a tower window overlooking a mighty plain and river lit by the full moon; and in the silent city that spread away from the river bank he thought he beheld some feature or arrangement which he had known before .
the matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me, and at times i had visions of personal fame from researches into its origin and connexions .
and for seventeen years after that west would look frequently over his shoulder, and complain of fancied footsteps behind him .
and old folk tell of pleasing voices heard singing there, and of laughter that swells with joys beyond earth 's joys; and say that at evening the little low windows are brighter than formerly .
how little does the earth self know of life and its extent how little, indeed, ought it to know for its own tranquillity of the oppressor i cannot speak .
and behind the houses were walled rose gardens with hedged paths and sundials, where at evening the moon and stars would shine bewitchingly while fragrant blossoms glistened with dew .
drawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter, i once more consulted the grocery boy 's map with the aid of the flashlight .
he did not respond, and still the viol shrieked on without slackening .
it is well that the reader accept nothing which follows as objective truth, for since the events transcend natural law, they are necessarily the subjective and unreal creations of my overtaxed mind .
i returned to the boat as my electric batteries grew feeble, resolved to explore the rock temple on the following day .
being now afraid to live alone in the ancient house on the moor, i departed on the following day for london, taking with me the amulet after destroying by fire and burial the rest of the impious collection in the museum .
it   's a frightful thing to have alive, but it isn't as bad as what wilbur would have let in if he'd lived longer .
he lives all alone with his streaked cat in gray 's inn, and people call him harmlessly mad .
he was principal of the east high school, born and bred in boston and sharing new england 's self satisfied deafness to the delicate overtones of life .
when near the front door he seemed to think of something, and turned back in his flight, finally disappearing down the stairs to the cellar .
the hermes of kalos stood in a marble shrine in corinth, and the pallas of musides surmounted a pillar in athens, near the parthenon .
after an interval, however, we approached the pit again, and found the exhalations less unbearable .
those scars was it like that? ''
and that look in the staring eyed faces of my grandmother and self slain uncle might be sheer fancy on my part sheer fancy, bolstered up by the innsmouth shadow which had so darkly coloured my imagination .
of scepticism there was none .
warning me that many of the street signs were down, the youth drew for my benefit a rough but ample and painstaking sketch map of the town 's salient features .
over the seas there was a great victory, and in triumph most of the young men returned .
and a thousand years of riches and delight passed over sarnath, wonder of the world and pride of all mankind .
alone i buried him beneath the stones of the courtyard about which he had loved to wander in life .
it struck me as horribly like a sort of oriental ceremony, with beating of drums and chanting of many voices .
he got this in london, i guess he uster like ter buy things at the shops .
nevertheless i followed him; for in those dreary days my quest for antique beauty and mystery was all that i had to keep my soul alive, and i reckoned it a rare favour of fate to fall in with one whose kindred seekings seemed to have penetrated so much farther than mine .

our seat on the tomb was very comfortable, and i knew that my prosaic friend would not mind the cavernous rift in the ancient, root disturbed brickwork close behind us, or the utter blackness of the spot brought by the intervention of a tottering, deserted seventeenth century house between us and the nearest lighted road .

i had a curious desire to look out of that window, over the wall and down the unseen slope at the glittering roofs and spires which must lie outspread there .
then i thought of the abandoned railway to rowley, whose solid line of ballasted, weed grown earth still stretched off to the northwest from the crumbling station on the edge of the river gorge .
the sky grew very dark, and the watchers hoped that the storm would prove a short, sharp one followed by clear weather .

the curious manuscript record or diary of wilbur whateley, delivered to miskatonic university for translation, had caused much worry and bafflement among the experts in languages both ancient and modern; its very alphabet, notwithstanding a general resemblance to the heavily shaded arabic used in mesopotamia, being absolutely unknown to any available authority .
on the occasion of the visit, ran the professor  's manuscript, the sculptor abruptly asked for the benefit of his host's archaeological knowledge in identifying the hieroglyphics on the bas relief .

holding with haeckel that all life is a chemical and physical process, and that the so called  ''soul '' is a myth, my friend believed that artificial reanimation of the dead can depend only on the condition of the tissues; and that unless actual decomposition has set in, a corpse fully equipped with organs may with suitable measures be set going again in the peculiar fashion known as life .
when the view of the water again opened out this time on my right i was half determined not to look at it at all .
the space south of the house, abutting on benefit street, was of course greatly above the existing sidewalk level, forming a terrace bounded by a high bank wall of damp, mossy stone pierced by a steep flight of narrow steps which led inward between canyon like surfaces to the upper region of mangy lawn, rheumy brick walls, and neglected gardens whose dismantled cement urns, rusted kettles fallen from tripods of knotty sticks, and similar paraphernalia set off the weather beaten front door with its broken fanlight, rotting ionic pilasters, and wormy triangular pediment .
the scene i cannot describe i should faint if i tried it, for there is madness in a room full of classified charnel things, with blood and lesser human debris almost ankle deep on the slimy floor, and with hideous reptilian abnormalities sprouting, bubbling, and baking over a winking bluish green spectre of dim flame in a far corner of black shadows .
this thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural malignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a rectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters .
springing to the floor, he washed and dressed in frantic haste, as if it were necessary for him to get out of the house as quickly as possible .
herbert west, whose associate and assistant i was, possessed scientific interests far beyond the usual routine of a village physician .
finally i was sure it was not a face at all, but a fiendishly cunning mask .
a weak, filtered glow from the rain harassed street lamps outside, and a feeble phosphorescence from the detestable fungi within, shewed the dripping stone of the walls, from which all traces of whitewash had vanished; the dank, foetid, and mildew tainted hard earth floor with its obscene fungi; the rotting remains of what had been stools, chairs, and tables, and other more shapeless furniture; the heavy planks and massive beams of the ground floor overhead; the decrepit plank door leading to bins and chambers beneath other parts of the house; the crumbling stone staircase with ruined wooden hand rail; and the crude and cavernous fireplace of blackened brick where rusted iron fragments revealed the past presence of hooks, andirons, spit, crane, and a door to the dutch oven these things, and our austere cot and camp chairs, and the heavy and intricate destructive machinery we had brought .
i believe that my mind was partly unhinged by events since august th; the daemon shadow in the mansion, the general strain and disappointment, and the thing that occurred at the hamlet in an october storm .
it is only the inferior thinker who hastens to explain the singular and the complex by the primitive short cut of supernaturalism .

they must have fixed up some awful scare for that fellow .
it had rested a heavy arm or fore leg on my chest    . . . .
once in a while i noticed dead stumps and crumbling foundation walls above the drifting sand, and recalled the old tradition quoted in one of the histories i had read, that this was once a fertile and thickly settled countryside .
my formerly silent tongue waxed voluble with the easy grace of a chesterfield or the godless cynicism of a rochester .
i likewise did much of his shopping, and gasped in bafflement at some of the chemicals he ordered from druggists and laboratory supply houses .
wisely did ibn schacabao say, that happy is the tomb where no wizard hath lain, and happy the town at night whose wizards are all ashes .
gradually i had come to be his inseparable assistant, and now that we were out of college we had to keep together .
bizarre manifestations were now too frequent to count .

he climbed interminably along the grotesque stone moulding that is, one would call it climbing if the thing was not after all horizontal and the men wondered how any door in the universe could be so vast .
that hallowe 'en the hill noises sounded louder than ever, and fire burned on sentinel hill as usual; but people paid more attention to the rhythmical screaming of vast flocks of unnaturally belated whippoorwills which seemed to be assembled near the unlighted whateley farmhouse .
that night slater slept quietly, and the next morning he wakened with no singular feature save a certain alteration of expression .
the shadow i had seen, i hardly dared to analyse or identify .
i reached out to uncurl and look at it, when suddenly i saw pickman start as if shot .
the expression on her face was one of hideous malevolence and exultation, and when he awaked he could recall a croaking voice that persuaded and threatened .
sometimes it enters directly into the composition of the events, while sometimes it relates only to their fortuitous position among persons and places .
my host appeared not to notice this, and in courtesy i kept silent as he piloted me up a curving stairway, across a hall, and into a room whose door i heard him lock behind us .
romero and i moved without material hesitancy through drifts and down ladders; ever toward the thing that allured us, yet ever with a pitifully helpless fear and reluctance .
two hundred years and more they have leaned or squatted there, while the vines have crawled and the trees have swelled and spread .
as he went upstairs and across the garret hall he sprinkled about some flour which he had borrowed with a frank admission as to its purpose from the landlord .
i can still see herbert west under the sinister electric light as he injected his reanimating solution into the arm of the headless body .

i would have to count on sheer speed, and the chance of getting to a window before any hostile forces became coördinated enough to open the right door toward me with a pass key .
the sphinx is his cousin, and he speaks her language; but he is more ancient than the sphinx, and remembers that which she hath forgotten .
slowly, amidst the distorted horrors of that indescribable scene, she began to churn the lethal waters; whilst on the masonry of that charnel shore that was not of earth the titan thing from the stars slavered and gibbered like polypheme cursing the fleeing ship of odysseus .

i   've had 'em pointed out to me here though, come to think of it, the elder children don't seem to be around lately .
at this point i was left to imagine the solution of the greatest mystery of all, how the curse had been fulfilled since that time when charles le sorcier must in the course of nature have died, for the man digressed into an account of the deep alchemical studies of the two wizards, father and son, speaking most particularly of the researches of charles le sorcier concerning the elixir which should grant to him who partook of it eternal life and youth .
gilman whose ears had so lately possessed an abnormal sensitiveness was now stone deaf .
one might, for example, pass into a timeless dimension and emerge at some remote period of the earth 's history as young as before .

so here we all were in the mystic sunset of the autumn hills old scribonius libo in his toga prætexta, the golden light glancing on his shiny bald head and wrinkled hawk face, balbutius with his gleaming helmet and breastplate, blue shaven lips compressed in conscientiously dogged opposition, young asellius with his polished greaves and superior sneer, and the curious throng of townsfolk, legionaries, tribesmen, peasants, lictors, slaves, and attendants .
on april th the derelict was sighted; and though apparently deserted, was found upon boarding to contain one survivor in a half delirious condition and one man who had evidently been dead for more than a week .
i think that these things were supposed to depict men at least, a certain sort of men; though the creatures were shewn disporting like fishes in the waters of some marine grotto, or paying homage at some monolithic shrine which appeared to be under the waves as well .
i felt sensations like those one feels when accidentally scratching ground glass .
before the marble walls on the appointed night were pitched the pavilions of princes and the tents of travellers, and all the shore resounded with the song of happy revellers .
he reigns there still, and will reign happily forever, though below the cliffs at innsmouth the channel tides played mockingly with the body of a tramp who had stumbled through the half deserted village at dawn; played mockingly, and cast it upon the rocks by ivy covered trevor towers, where a notably fat and especially offensive millionaire brewer enjoys the purchased atmosphere of extinct nobility .

what was the land of these wanderers none could tell; but it was seen that they were given to strange prayers, and that they had painted on the sides of their wagons strange figures with human bodies and the heads of cats, hawks, rams, and lions .
i saw the attic laboratory, the electrical machine, and the unsightly form of tillinghast opposite me; but of all the space unoccupied by familiar material objects not one particle was vacant .
one seldom saw them; but a few times a year they sent down little yellow, squint eyed messengers who looked like scythians to trade with the merchants by means of gestures, and every spring and autumn they held the infamous rites on the peaks, their howlings and altar fires throwing terror into the villages .
the thing must have happened at about three thirty in the afternoon .
i s   'pose it's cheap enough, but i never see more'n two or three people in it nobody but those innsmouth folks .
the curator of the historical society there mr   . e. lapham peabody was very courteous about assisting me, and expressed unusual interest when i told him i was a grandson of eliza orne of arkham, who was born in and had married james williamson of ohio at the age of seventeen.

i am not given to emotion of any kind, but my amazement was very great when i saw what lay revealed in that electrical glow .
i felt conscious of youth because i remembered so little .
and when tales fly thick in the grottoes of tritons, and conches in seaweed cities blow wild tunes learned from the elder ones, then great eager vapours flock to heaven laden with lore; and kingsport, nestling uneasy on its lesser cliffs below that awesome hanging sentinel of rock, sees oceanward only a mystic whiteness, as if the cliff 's rim were the rim of all earth, and the solemn bells of the buoys tolled free in the aether of faery .

as i gazed, i perceived that my own brain held the key to these enchanting metamorphoses; for each vista which appeared to me, was the one my changing mind most wished to behold .
it is not known how long iranon tarried in oonai, but one day the king brought to the palace some wild whirling dancers from the liranian desert, and dusky flute players from drinen in the east, and after that the revellers threw their roses not so much at iranon as at the dancers and the flute players .

but i do not fear him now, for i suspect that he has known horrors beyond my ken .
too many folks missin   ' too much wild preachin' at meetin' of a sunday too much talk abaout that reef .
curtis whateley was only just regaining consciousness when the arkham men came slowly down the mountain in the beams of a sunlight once more brilliant and untainted .
gilman sat in a daze all the afternoon, and elwood who had meanwhile seen the papers and formed terrible conjectures from them found him thus when he came home .
on an improvised dissecting table in the old farmhouse, by the light of a powerful acetylene lamp, the specimen was not very spectral looking .
it was a very foolish hysteria, for the boy had often run away before; but italian peasants are exceedingly superstitious, and this woman seemed as much harassed by omens as by facts .
the effect of this volume had not left me, and i felt a certain hesitancy in speaking of it; but curiosity overmastered all the vague fears which had steadily accumulated since my first glimpse of the house .

of the cattle, only a quarter could be found and identified .
but the archon was sullen and did not understand, and rebuked the stranger .
the ancient books taken from whateley 's quarters, while absorbingly interesting and in several cases promising to open up new and terrible lines of research among philosophers and men of science, were of no assistance whatever in this matter .
still, no one durst complain to the sinister couple; even when little atal, the innkeeper 's son, vowed that he had at twilight seen all the cats of ulthar in that accursed yard under the trees, pacing very slowly and solemnly in a circle around the cottage, two abreast, as if in performance of some unheard of rite of beasts .
at night the subtle stirring of the black city outside, the sinister scurrying of rats in the wormy partitions, and the creaking of hidden timbers in the centuried house, were enough to give him a sense of strident pandemonium .
it was something i found in my coat the next morning .
but now zadok was shaking me, and i turned back to watch the melting of that fear frozen face into a chaos of twitching eyelids and mumbling gums .

my first impulse on awaking was to communicate all my fears and observations to denys barry, but as i saw the sunlight glowing through the latticed east window i became sure that there was no reality in what i thought i had seen .
everything he saw was unspeakably menacing and horrible; and whenever one of the organic entities appeared by its motions to be noticing him, he felt a stark, hideous fright which generally jolted him awake .
this old man dwells all alone in a very ancient house on water street near the sea, and is reputed to be both exceedingly rich and exceedingly feeble; which forms a situation very attractive to men of the profession of messrs  . ricci, czanek, and silva, for that profession was nothing less dignified than robbery.
when the crowd was gone i saw the grave bearded man who had brought me to this place standing alone with a lantern .
and i would tell myself that the realm beyond the wall was not more lasting merely, but more lovely and radiant as well .
this verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbed professor angell .
our means of receiving impressions are absurdly few, and our notions of surrounding objects infinitely narrow .
seeing a possible means of avoiding the dangerous jump, i yanked at the hangings and brought them down, pole and all; then quickly hooking two of the rings in the shutter catch and flinging the drapery outside .

with whimpering insistence the squatters told tales of a daemon which seized lone wayfarers after dark, either carrying them off or leaving them in a frightful state of gnawed dismemberment; while sometimes they whispered of blood trails toward the distant mansion .
there was some of it in wilbur whateley himself enough to make a devil and a precocious monster of him, and to make his passing out a pretty terrible sight .
it seemed strange that old gregory, at least, should desert his master without telling as tried a friend as i .
 ''glad to know you, sheehan, '' said trever in a quiet, well bred tone .
if this man could not be restored to life, no one would know of our experiment .
besides, the streets were loathsomely dark .
he saw that most of them, in common with their cast off priestcraft, could not escape from the delusion that life has a meaning apart from that which men dream into it; and could not lay aside the crude notion of ethics and obligations beyond those of beauty, even when all nature shrieked of its unconsciousness and impersonal unmorality in the light of their scientific discoveries .

snatches of conversation indicated beyond a doubt that neither romero nor i had left the bunkhouse during the night; that neither had been awake during the frightful storm which had passed over the cactus range .
but all these precautions came late in the day, so that gilman had some terrible hints from the dreaded necronomicon of abdul alhazred, the fragmentary book of eibon, and the suppressed unaussprechlichen kulten of von junzt to correlate with his abstract formulae on the properties of space and the linkage of dimensions known and unknown .

the tomb legions when dr  . herbert west disappeared a year ago, the boston police questioned me closely.
there is a false report very commonly reproduced in modern books prior to von schweinkopf  's monumental geschichte der ostrogothen in italien that ibid was a romanised visigoth of ataulf's horde who settled in placentia about a   .d. the contrary cannot be too strongly emphasised; for von schweinkopf, and since his time littlewit and bêtenoir, have shewn with irrefutable force that this strikingly isolated figure was a genuine roman or at least as genuine a roman as that degenerate and mongrelised age could produce of whom one might well say what gibbon said of boethius,  ''that he was the last whom cato or tully could have acknowledged for their countryman. ''
and so the prisoner toiled in the twilight, heaving the unresponsive remnants of mortality with little ceremony as his miniature tower of babel rose course by course .
then in the shadowy solitude my longing for light grew so frantic that i could rest no more, and i lifted entreating hands to the single black ruined tower that reached above the forest into the unknown outer sky .

had he actually slipped outside our sphere to points unguessed and unimaginable?
kuranes had awaked the very moment he beheld the city, yet he knew from his brief glance that it was none other than celephaïs, in the valley of ooth nargai beyond the tanarian hills, where his spirit had dwelt all the eternity of an hour one summer afternoon very long ago, when he had slipt away from his nurse and let the warm sea breeze lull him to sleep as he watched the clouds from the cliff near the village .
the room became pandemonium, and men screamed and howled in fright at the sinister being they had aroused .
he was a man of immense height, probably more than six feet, though his stooping shoulders sometimes belied this fact .
this tranquillity was the more remarkable, because we had amongst us gentlemen of very opposed opinions .
the months following my discovery were spent in futile attempts to force the complicated padlock of the slightly open vault, and in carefully guarded inquiries regarding the nature and history of the structure .
just as they galloped up the rising ground to the precipice a golden glare came somewhere out of the east and hid all the landscape in its effulgent draperies .
his advice, moreover, was eminently practical; for he recommended a postponement of operations at the martense mansion until we might become fortified with more detailed historical and geographical data .
the walls melted away, and i was swept by a black wind through gulfs of fathomless grey with the needle like pinnacles of unknown mountains miles below me .
when tales fly thick in the grottoes of tritons, and conches in seaweed cities blow wild tunes learned from the elder ones, then great eager mists flock to heaven laden with lore, and oceanward eyes on the rocks see only a mystic whiteness, as if the cliff 's rim were the rim of all earth, and the solemn bells of buoys tolled free in the aether of faery .
this man, a vagabond, hunter, and trapper, had always been strange in the eyes of his primitive associates .
mamie 's visit was frankly one of curiosity, and her subsequent tales did justice to her observations; but zechariah came to lead a pair of alderney cows which old whateley had bought of his son curtis .
yet after all, the sight was worse than i had dreaded .
it was good theory, but couldn 't keep up indefinitely .
the most merciful thing in the world, i think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents .
he had turned restlessly on the cot several times during the latter half of the first hour, but now he was breathing with unusual irregularity, occasionally heaving a sigh which held more than a few of the qualities of a choking moan .
i think that whoever nursed me must have been shockingly aged, since my first conception of a living person was that of something mockingly like myself, yet distorted, shrivelled, and decaying like the castle .
next would come the south windows, under the great low eaves on the side where he stood; and it must be said that he was more than uncomfortable as he thought of the detestable house on one side and the vacancy of upper air on the other .
i was glad of that tide, for at high water the fishy smell might not be so bad .
at these times he would shew a sardonic humour and make remarks which the folk of sheehan 's deemed foolish and irrational .
innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable, and i turned down paine street toward the square in the hope of getting some vehicle to take me to arkham before the still distant starting time of that sinister bus .
my back was toward the fishy smelling sea, but he was facing it, and something or other had caused his wandering gaze to light on the low, distant line of devil reef, then shewing plainly and almost fascinatingly above the waves .
sometimes, as a psychological experiment, i would lead him on in these wanderings, and listen to his endless poetical quotations and tales of sunken ships .
but something would have to be done about those rats .
what i did there i may not say, for i am not now sure of the reality of certain things; but i know that on the day after such a nocturnal ramble i would often astonish those about me with my knowledge of topics almost forgotten for many generations .

urged on by an impulse which i cannot definitely analyse, i scrambled with difficulty down the rocks and stood on the gentler slope beneath, gazing into the stygian deeps where no light had yet penetrated .
his thinking processes, once so phlegmatic and logical, had become ineffaceably scarred; and it was pitiful to note his response to certain chance allusions such as  ''friday '',  ''tomb '',  ''coffin '', and words of less obvious concatenation .
the moans of the sick men were decidedly annoying; but since they did not appear to demoralise the rest of the crew, we did not resort to extreme measures .
i looked at zann, and saw that he was past conscious observation .
i think we screamed ourselves as we stumbled frantically toward the town, though as we reached the outskirts we put on a semblance of restraint just enough to seem like belated revellers staggering home from a debauch .
they   've ben telling things about innsmouth whispering 'em, mostly for the last hundred years, i guess, and i gather they're more scared than anything else .
i got into the habit of calling on pickman quite often, especially after i began making notes for a monograph on weird art .

the phantasmal, unmentionable thing occurred one midnight late in march, , in a field hospital behind the lines at st  . eloi.
the great war was then at its very beginning, and the ocean forces of the hun had not completely sunk to their later degradation; so that our vessel was made a legitimate prize, whilst we of her crew were treated with all the fairness and consideration due us as naval prisoners .
and dogs barked as the yellow light of small paned windows shone out at the farther turn, and the pleiades twinkled across the open knoll where a great gambrel roof stood black against the dim west .
there are things about which it is better not to speculate, and all that i can say is that i hate the smell of ammonia, and grow faint at a draught of unusually cool air .
just before he made the plunge the violet light went out and left him in utter blackness .
for some time, apparently, the curious angles of gilman 's room had been having a strange, almost hypnotic effect on him; and as the bleak winter advanced he had found himself staring more and more intently at the corner where the down slanting ceiling met the inward slanting wall .
then one night as i listened at the door i heard the shrieking viol swell into a chaotic babel of sound; a pandemonium which would have led me to doubt my own shaking sanity had there not come from behind that barred portal a piteous proof that the horror was real the awful, inarticulate cry which only a mute can utter, and which rises only in moments of the most terrible fear or anguish .
tillinghast had been watching me, and noted my puzzled expression .

after a moment there came another soft rattling, and i knew that the room to the south of me was being entered .
that we bore electric lanterns, spades, and a curious coil of wire with attached instruments, i will even affirm; for these things all played a part in the single hideous scene which remains burned into my shaken recollection .

brown jenkin was rubbing itself with a kind of affectionate playfulness around the ankles of the black man, which the deep mud largely concealed .
we lived as recluses; devoid of friends, alone, and without servants in a few rooms of an ancient manor house on a bleak and unfrequented moor; so that our doors were seldom disturbed by the knock of the visitor .

dark, frail, and somewhat unkempt in aspect, he turned languidly at my knock and asked me my business without rising .
through all the land of mnar and the lands adjacent spread the tales of those who had fled from sarnath, and caravans sought that accursed city and its precious metals no more .
as i thought of these things i looked out over the squalid sea of decaying roofs below me, now brightened by the beams of a moon not much past full .
it is true that i have for five years been his closest friend, and a partial sharer of his terrible researches into the unknown .

elwood, whose thoughts on the entire episode are sometimes almost maddening, came back to college the next autumn and graduated in the following june .
parker slipped as the other three were plunging frenziedly over endless vistas of green crusted rock to the boat, and johansen swears he was swallowed up by an angle of masonry which shouldn 't have been there; an angle which was acute, but behaved as if it were obtuse .
and their fear and dismay increased when they searched the fallen apartment; for of the gentle musides, and of the marvellously fashioned image of tyché, no trace could be discovered .
next day he would make some very guarded inquiries and perhaps see the nerve specialist .
the title of the picture was,  ''holmes, lowell, and longfellow lie buried in mount auburn '' .

he was unconscious, having fallen in a kind of convulsion which imparted to his slight black clad body a strange rigidity .
the form near me seemed to feel a change also, for it gradually brought its discourse toward a conclusion, and itself prepared to quit the scene; fading from my sight at a rate somewhat less rapid than that of the other objects .
when i had entered the room i had shut the door behind me .
after that the scene was almost wholly kaleidoscopic, and in the jumble of sights, sounds, and unidentified sense impressions i felt that i was about to dissolve or in some way lose the solid form .

then the two rowed to a galley in the harbour, and giving orders to the oarsmen, commenced to sail out into the billowy cerenerian sea that leads to the sky .
at the last moment i decided i had better slacken my trot and make the crossing as before in the shambling gait of an average innsmouth native .
the lodgers and police on that night soothed me, and the doctor administered something to quiet me, nor did anyone see what a nightmare event had taken place .
klenze seemed paralysed and inefficient, as one might expect of a soft, womanish rhinelander .
it was partly because of that laugh that reid dropped him .
our auckland correspondent gives the emma and her crew an excellent reputation, and johansen is described as a sober and worthy man .
i had largely given over my inquiries into what professor angell called the  ''cthulhu cult '', and was visiting a learned friend in paterson, new jersey; the curator of a local museum and a mineralogist of note .
when he took down the shutter the wind and rain howled deafeningly in, so that i could not hear what he said; but i waited while he leaned out and tried to fathom nature 's pandemonium .
it was after this that he cultivated deliberate illusion, and dabbled in the notions of the bizarre and the eccentric as an antidote for the commonplace .
despite their distance below me i at once knew they were the servants brought from the north, for i recognised the ugly and unwieldy form of the cook, whose very absurdness had now become unutterably tragic .
now, in spite of all that guidance, alfred trever was at sheehan 's and about to take his first drink .
family and neighbours had now fled in a panic, and when the more courageous of them returned, slater was gone, leaving behind an unrecognisable pulp like thing that had been a living man but an hour before .
that he was right, i soon learned from the unutterable fear which engulfed me whenever consciousness lapsed .
people around the country and in the nearby towns muttered a great deal among themselves, but said very little to the outer world .
with only a slight churning to mark its rise to the surface, the thing slid into view above the dark waters .

it had for some time been noticed that dogs had begun to hate and fear the whole whateley place as violently as they hated and feared young wilbur personally .
the present voodoo orgy was, indeed, on the merest fringe of this abhorred area, but that location was bad enough; hence perhaps the very place of the worship had terrified the squatters more than the shocking sounds and incidents .
all were pointing to a certain passage, and every face seemed so distorted with epileptic and reverberant laughter that i almost thought i heard the fiendish echoes .
i was celebrating my coming of age by a tour of new england sightseeing, antiquarian, and genealogical and had planned to go directly from ancient newburyport to arkham, whence my mother 's family was derived .

as soon as dombrowski left it the pall of its final desolation began to descend, for people shunned it both on account of its old reputation and because of the new foetid odour .
he will, i believe, some time be heard from as one of the great decadents; for he has crystallised in clay and will one day mirror in marble those nightmares and phantasies which arthur machen evokes in prose, and clark ashton smith makes visible in verse and in painting .
so little is known of what went on beneath the surface so little, yet such a ghastly festering as it bubbles up putrescently in occasional ghoulish glimpses .
as i thought of him new terrors convulsed me, and i fell to the floor; not fainting, but physically helpless .
he watched and listened with his mind more than with his eyes and ears, and strove every moment to drown something in his ceaseless poring over gay, insipid novels .
 ''oh, my gawd, my gawd, '' the voice choked out .
i was sorry i had put out the light, yet was too tired to rise and turn it on again .
instead there was a clatter of people coming up with lanterns, for the spell of phantasmal silence had broken, and i once more heard sounds and saw figures as normally tri dimensional .
someone telephoned the news to the aylesbury transcript; but the editor, accustomed to wild tales from dunwich, did no more than concoct a humorous paragraph about it; an item soon afterward reproduced by the associated press .

now, after a moment of silence during which the walker may have been inspecting my bicycle in the hall, i heard a fumbling at the latch and saw the panelled portal swing open again .

considerable talk was started when silas bishop of the undecayed bishops mentioned having seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother about an hour before the blaze was remarked .
once inside one of the decrepit brick structures i would have to reckon with pursuit; but i hoped to descend and dodge in and out of yawning doorways along the shadowed courtyard, eventually getting to washington street and slipping out of town toward the south .
most of the students went home, or to various duties, as the evening advanced; but west persuaded me to aid him in  ''making a night of it '' .

as time wore along, his absorption in the irregular wall and ceiling of his room increased; for he began to read into the odd angles a mathematical significance which seemed to offer vague clues regarding their purpose .
i had read many scrolls out of syria and ægyptus, and the cryptic towns of etruria, and had talked at length with the bloodthirsty priest of diana aricina in his temple in the woods bordering lacus nemorensis .
the moon, now near the zenith, shone weirdly and vividly above the towering steeps that hemmed in the chasm, and revealed the fact that a far flung body of water flowed at the bottom, winding out of sight in both directions, and almost lapping my feet as i stood on the slope .
baleful primal trees of unholy size, age, and grotesqueness leered above me like the pillars of some hellish druidic temple; muffling the thunder, hushing the clawing wind, and admitting but little rain .
into the north window of my chamber glows the pole star with uncanny light .
an inappropriate hour, a jarring lighting effect, or a clumsy manipulation of the damp sod, would almost totally destroy for us that ecstatic titillation which followed the exhumation of some ominous, grinning secret of the earth .
nothing can be put back now .
i might never have known dr  . muñoz had it not been for the heart attack that suddenly seized me one forenoon as i sat writing in my room.
it would perhaps have been easier to keep my thoughts from disturbing topics had the room not been so gruesomely musty .
dr  . muñoz, most certainly, was a man of birth, cultivation, and discrimination.
once we fancied that a large, opaque body darkened the library window when the moon was shining against it, and another time we thought we heard a whirring or flapping sound not far off .
this collection frightens away most of the small boys who love to taunt the terrible old man about his long white hair and beard, or to break the small paned windows of his dwelling with wicked missiles; but there are other things which frighten the older and more curious folk who sometimes steal up to the house to peer in through the dusty panes .

with this work romero and i were not connected, wherefore our first knowledge of extraordinary conditions came from others .
the old man was panting, and perspiring profusely .
after a number of calculations west decided that it represented some secret chamber beneath the tomb of the averills, where the last interment had been made in  .
i struck several matches in succession, and desperately regretted the improvidence which had caused us long ago to use up the few candles we carried .
of graves and tombs i knew and imagined much, but had on account of my peculiar temperament been kept from all personal contact with churchyards and cemeteries .
they were huguenots from caude, and had encountered much opposition before the providence selectmen allowed them to settle in the town .
nor did anything that had been alive come alive from the ruins .

i  'm going to burn his accursed diary, and if you men are wise you'll dynamite that altar stone up there, and pull down all the rings of standing stones on the other hills .
all honour was now his, since the tyrant of syracuse would have the work of none save him or kalos .
and when the red aldebaran had crawled more than half way around the horizon, there were again darkness and silence .

they from outside will help, but they cannot take body without human blood .
with this friend, joel manton, i had often languidly disputed .
he told me it was an old german viol player, a strange dumb man who signed his name as erich zann, and who played evenings in a cheap theatre orchestra; adding that zann 's desire to play in the night after his return from the theatre was the reason he had chosen this lofty and isolated garret room, whose single gable window was the only point on the street from which one could look over the terminating wall at the declivity and panorama beyond .
manton remained thoughtful as i said this, but gradually reverted to his analytical mood .
then they both started for the outer door; the woman lamely creeping, and the old man, after picking up the very book i had been reading, beckoning me as he drew his hood over that unmoving face or mask .
the disposition of old bugs was as odd as his aspect .
he was good for nothing that morning, and stayed away from all his classes .

so came he one night to the squalid cot of an antique shepherd, bent and dirty, who kept lean flocks on a stony slope above a quicksand marsh .
the next day both youths felt very tired, and knew they would sleep like logs when night came .
endlessly down the horsemen floated, their chargers pawing the aether as if galloping over golden sands; and then the luminous vapours spread apart to reveal a greater brightness, the brightness of the city celephaïs, and the sea coast beyond, and the snowy peak overlooking the sea, and the gaily painted galleys that sail out of the harbour toward distant regions where the sea meets the sky .
then came a period when luck was poor; interments fell off, and those that did occur were of specimens either too diseased or too maimed for use .
the event which i am about to relate was unheralded by long premonitions .
  ''that is, sailors that didn't hail from innsmouth .
and her friend pete stowacki would not help because he wanted the child out of the way anyhow .
and again we saw a tram car, lone, windowless, dilapidated, and almost on its side .
and there were many small shrines and temples where one might rest or pray to small gods .
but though iranon was sad he ceased not to sing, and at evening told again his dreams of aira, the city of marble and beryl .
the most sumptuous of these with wide terraced parterres extending back the whole way to lafayette street i took to be the home of old man marsh, the afflicted refinery owner .
they never unlocked that attic door, but left the whole house as it was, dreaded and deserted .
wretched is he who looks back upon lone hours in vast and dismal chambers with brown hangings and maddening rows of antique books, or upon awed watches in twilight groves of grotesque, gigantic, and vine encumbered trees that silently wave twisted branches far aloft .
his habitual expression was one of kindly and well bred calm, whereas now a variety of emotions seemed struggling within him .
my head, heavy and reeling, drooped to my breast, and when next i looked up it was in a dream; with the pole star grinning at me through a window from over the horrible swaying trees of a dream swamp .
its rowers, though distantly and indistinctly seen, were of an especially repellent aspect .
i was pouring something from one test tube to another, and west was busy over the alcohol blast lamp which had to answer for a bunsen burner in this gasless edifice, when from the pitch black room we had left there burst the most appalling and daemoniac succession of cries that either of us had ever heard .
whilst the greater number of our nocturnal visions are perhaps no more than faint and fantastic reflections of our waking experiences freud to the contrary with his puerile symbolism there are still a certain remainder whose immundane and ethereal character permits of no ordinary interpretation, and whose vaguely exciting and disquieting effect suggests possible minute glimpses into a sphere of mental existence no less important than physical life, yet separated from that life by an all but impassable barrier .
dolphins still encircled the u , a somewhat remarkable circumstance considering the distance we had covered .
we had met years before, in medical school, and from the first i had shared his terrible researches .
it isn  't so very far from the elevated as distance goes, but it's centuries away as the soul goes .
it is to meet and conquer the oppressor that i have vainly striven for aeons, held back by bodily encumbrances .
it may have been just fear, and it may have been fear mixed with a queer belated sort of remorse for bygone crudities .
wonder had gone away, and he had forgotten that all life is only a set of pictures in the brain, among which there is no difference betwixt those born of real things and those born of inward dreamings, and no cause to value the one above the other .
and as if sharpened by the coming deprivation of light, my desire to explore the watery secrets grew .
he worked northwest along pleasant back roads, past hooper  's pond and the old brick powder house to where the pastures slope up to the ridge above the miskatonic and give a lovely vista of arkham's white georgian steeples across leagues of river and meadow .
just how fully the pursuit was organised and indeed, just what its purpose might be i could form no idea .
trying it, i found it locked; but with a supreme burst of strength i overcame all obstacles and dragged it open inward .
the air was warm and stirred not .
then they vanished, hurrying southward where they were fully a month overdue .
on the third morning of the wanderers ' stay in ulthar, menes could not find his kitten; and as he sobbed aloud in the market place certain villagers told him of the old man and his wife, and of sounds heard in the night .
i seem to ramble along without much logick or continuity when i endeavour to recall the past; and fear i light upon but few incidents which others have not before discuss 'd .
among the kaliris was an aged chief called mwanu, who possessed not only a highly retentive memory, but a singular degree of intelligence and interest in old legends .
their arrangement was odd, and seemed to follow the symmetries of some cosmic geometry unknown to earth or the solar system .
the negro had been knocked out, and a moment 's examination shewed us that he would permanently remain so .
slightly later, when a change and a gentle tremor seemed to affect the dead limbs, west stuffed a pillow like object violently over the twitching face, not withdrawing it until the corpse appeared quiet and ready for our attempt at reanimation .
in saying that west 's fear of his specimens was nebulous, i have in mind particularly its complex nature .
at last the figure spoke in a rumbling voice that chilled me through with its dull hollowness and latent malevolence .
the change happened whilst i slept .
they had chained him down to things that are, and had then explained the workings of those things till mystery had gone out of the world .
shaken with such a mental revolution as i had never before known, i now resolved to visit mate johansen in oslo .
  ''i believe there's a chance of putting it out of business .
i will tell only of the lone tomb in the darkest of the hillside thickets; the deserted tomb of the hydes, an old and exalted family whose last direct descendant had been laid within its black recesses many decades before my birth .
all my days have i watched it and listened to it, and i know it well .
it may have been wholly an hallucination from the shock caused at that instant by the sudden and complete destruction of the building in a cataclysm of german shell fire who can gainsay it, since west and i were the only proved survivors?
controlling my muscles, and realising afresh how plainly visible i was, i resumed my brisker and feignedly shambling pace; though keeping my eyes on that hellish and ominous reef as long as the opening of south street gave me a seaward view .
yet the force of the elements was such as to overcome my scruples, and i did not hesitate to wheel my machine up the weedy rise to the closed door which seemed at once so suggestive and secretive .
there were eaten many strange delicacies at that feast; peacocks from the isles of nariel in the middle ocean, young goats from the distant hills of implan, heels of camels from the bnazic desert, nuts and spices from cydathrian groves, and pearls from wave washed mtal dissolved in the vinegar of thraa .
some new and wild note in the drumming and chanting, perceptible but slightly to me, had acted on him in startling fashion; and with a wild outcry he forged ahead unguided in the cavern 's gloom .
god knows how many there were there must have been thousands .
a second later the downward motion of the knife broke the spell completely, and he dropped the bowl with a resounding bell like clangour while his hands darted out frantically to stop the monstrous deed .
he was gazing at me gaspingly and fascinatedly, but did not seem afraid .
the bolt fitted perfectly, and i was somewhat relieved when i knew that i could shoot it firmly upon retiring .
i calc     'late i was asleep, else i'd a heerd ye i ain't as young as i uster be, an' i need a paowerful sight o' naps naowadays .
i now bent to the left around the ruinous green; still gazing toward the ocean as it blazed in the spectral summer moonlight, and watching the cryptical flashing of those nameless, unexplainable beacons .
then he said we were the victims of a vicious bull though the animal was a difficult thing to place and account for .
there were secrets, said the peasants, which must not be uncovered; secrets that had lain hidden since the plague came to the children of partholan in the fabulous years beyond history .
ahead rose a narrow staircase, flanked by a small door probably leading to the cellar, while to the left and right were closed doors leading to rooms on the ground floor .
men looked at one another and muttered .

from the air of hushed fright at osborn 's store they knew something hideous had happened, and soon learned of the annihilation of the elmer frye house and family .
he hailed from arkham, boarded with a family who came from ipswich, and went back home whenever he got a moment off .
toward the last i became acutely afraid of west, for he began to look at me that way .
with five feeble senses we pretend to comprehend the boundlessly complex cosmos, yet other beings with a wider, stronger, or different range of senses might not only see very differently the things we see, but might see and study whole worlds of matter, energy, and life which lie close at hand yet can never be detected with the senses we have .
leaning my cycle against the wall i opened the door at the left, and crossed into a small low ceiled chamber but dimly lighted by its two dusty windows and furnished in the barest and most primitive possible way .
looks like a terrible rattletrap i 've never ben on it . ''
leading me within, he steered a course in utter blackness over what seemed to be a gravel path, and finally up a flight of stone steps to the door of the house, which he unlocked and opened for me .
their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid, while their heads were the heads of fish, with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed .
besides, what was found might possibly have more than one explanation .
he evidently feared the physical effect of violent emotion, yet his will and driving force waxed rather than waned, and he refused to be confined to his bed .
he did not wish to go to sleep in a room alone especially since he thought he had glimpsed in the evening twilight the repellent old woman whose image had become so horribly transferred to his dreams .
i have always believed that such strange, inaccessible worlds exist at our very elbows, and now i believe i have found a way to break down the barriers .
vast, polyphemus like, and loathsome, it darted like a stupendous monster of nightmares to the monolith, about which it flung its gigantic scaly arms, the while it bowed its hideous head and gave vent to certain measured sounds .
for that visitor was neither italian nor policeman .
yog sothoth is the key to the gate, whereby the spheres meet .
there he would ask to be left alone, as if wishing to speak with unseen things .
i hardly know how to continue, since conditions so singular are involved; but i will do my best, not even trying to differentiate betwixt the real and the apparent .
once he had the landlord nail tin over it, but the next night the rats gnawed a fresh hole in making which they pushed or dragged out into the room a curious little fragment of bone .
no, he said hastily, as the question was put to him, he did not know the subject of the picture .
one must not, for example, linger much around the marsh refinery, or around any of the still used churches, or around the pillared order of dagon hall at new church green .
many of his questions seemed highly out of place to his visitor, especially those which tried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies; and wilcox could not understand the repeated promises of silence which he was offered in exchange for an admission of membership in some widespread mystical or paganly religious body .
but after a time his alcohol enfeebled brain would wander from the subject, and with a foolish grin he would turn once more to his mop or cleaning rag .
learning was in his blood, for his great grandfather, sir robert jermyn, bt  ., had been an anthropologist of note, whilst his great great great grandfather, sir wade jermyn, was one of the earliest explorers of the congo region, and had written eruditely of its tribes, animals, and supposed antiquities.
the shell had been merciful, in a way but west could never feel as certain as he wished, that we two were the only survivors .
  ''this is my first experience in a place like this, but i am a student of life, and don't want to miss any experience .
i do not know just how much of the whole tale has been told even to me, and i have many reasons for not wishing to probe deeper .
between gasps luther tried to stammer out his tale to mrs  . corey.
west was then a small, slender, spectacled youth with delicate features, yellow hair, pale blue eyes, and a soft voice, and it was uncanny to hear him dwelling on the relative merits of christchurch cemetery and the potter 's field .
during this description i had kept a tight rein on my emotions, but my face must have betrayed my mounting fears .
his features had perhaps been noble once, but were now seamed with the ghastly effects of terrible dissipation .
we could not get bodies fresh enough to shew any trace of reason when reanimated, so had perforce created nameless horrors .
it surely was bad enough there was riots over it, and all sorts of ghastly doings that i don 't believe ever got outside of town and it left the place in awful shape .
so far i had seen no people in the town, but there now came signs of a sparse habitation curtained windows here and there, and an occasional battered motor car at the curb .
to this day i do not know whether they saw me or not .
human utterance can best convey the general character of our experiences by calling them plungings or soarings; for in every period of revelation some part of our minds broke boldly away from all that is real and present, rushing aërially along shocking, unlighted, and fear haunted abysses, and occasionally tearing through certain well marked and typical obstacles describable only as viscous, uncouth clouds or vapours .
they talked of the old cotter and his wife, of the caravan of dark wanderers, of small menes and his black kitten, of the prayer of menes and of the sky during that prayer, of the doings of the cats on the night the caravan left, and of what was later found in the cottage under the dark trees in the repellent yard .
the doctor, though, was chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds outside; a seemingly limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their endless message in repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps of the dying man .
he did not know where he wished to go, but felt that once more he would have to sacrifice his classes .
curtis whateley of the undecayed branch was holding the telescope when the arkham party detoured radically from the swath .
i moved my hand to his head, whose mechanical nodding i was able to stop, and shouted in his ear that we must both flee from the unknown things of the night .
there are vocal qualities peculiar to men, and vocal qualities peculiar to beasts; and it is terrible to hear the one when the source should yield the other .
soon cross streets and junctions began to appear; those on the left leading to shoreward realms of unpaved squalor and decay, while those on the right shewed vistas of departed grandeur .
it was a grey, bleak day, with now and then a drizzle of rain; and heavier and heavier clouds seemed to be piling themselves up beyond the hills to the northwest .
our freedom from long sleep was surprising, for seldom did we succumb more than an hour or two at a time to the shadow which had now grown so frightful a menace .
then came a noxious rush of noisome, frigid air from that same dreaded direction, followed by a piercing shriek just beside me on that shocking rifted tomb of man and monster .
birch, before , had been the village undertaker of peck valley; and was a very calloused and primitive specimen even as such specimens go .
if it came from within the house, we had the window ladders; if from outside, the door and the stairs .
his wilder wanderings were very startling indeed, including frantic appeals that something in a boarded up farmhouse be destroyed, and fantastic references to some plan for the extirpation of the entire human race and all animal and vegetable life from the earth by some terrible elder race of beings from another dimension .
they would perhaps be the worst of all innsmouth types something one would not care to remember .
i will not deny, though my memory is uncertain and indistinct, that this witness of yours may have seen us together as he says, on the gainesville pike, walking toward big cypress swamp, at half past eleven on that awful night .
those visions, however, were of abhorrent vividness and convincingness, and whenever he awaked he retained a vague sense of having undergone much more than he remembered .
i myself would have thought of biological degeneration rather than alienage .
for what could be the meaning of the queer clay bas relief and the disjointed jottings, ramblings, and cuttings which i found?
i must have left dust prints in that last old building, revealing how i had gained the street .
you, sir, are the first outsider to be told there is a secret, and split me if i 'd have risked tampering that much with the powers had ye not been so hot after bygone things . ''
there was an open space around the church; partly a churchyard with spectral shafts, and partly a half paved square swept nearly bare of snow by the wind, and lined with unwholesomely archaic houses having peaked roofs and overhanging gables .
he knows where they have trod earth 's fields, and where they still tread them, and why no one can behold them as they tread .
this daemoniac laughter which i hear as i write comes only from my own weakening brain .
i know i  'm more nervous than i was when you saw me last year, but you don't need to hold a clinic over it .
i glanced back at the sea, but there was nothing there .
you know what he wants .
almost the first long passage that armitage deciphered, an entry dated november , , proved highly startling and disquieting .
so famous were kalos and musides, that none wondered when the tyrant of syracuse sent to them deputies to speak of the costly statue of tyché which he had planned for his city .
once a student of reanimation, this silent trunk was now gruesomely called upon to exemplify it .
west had a private laboratory in an east room of the barn like temporary edifice, assigned him on his plea that he was devising new and radical methods for the treatment of hitherto hopeless cases of maiming .
where if anywhere had he been on those nights of daemoniac alienage?
there was a brief silence, and in that pause the scattered senses of poor curtis whateley began to knit back into a sort of continuity; so that he put his hands to his head with a moan .
i went to the war, an   ' ef i'd a had any guts or sense i'd a never come back, but settled away from here .

they are on the duke   's wedding, and so much resemble in quality the work of other and more recent poetick dunces, that i cannot forbear copying them:  ''when the duke of leeds shall marry'd be to a fine young lady of high quality how happy will that gentlewoman be in his grace of leeds' good company . ''
why had it picked them, and left me for the last?    . . .

his clutch relaxed, and as he saw my disgust and offence his own anger seemed to subside .
in the ashes of the fateful cabin i found several bones, but apparently none of the monster 's .
that afternoon we found the new grave, and determined to begin work soon after midnight .
our experiences had often been hideous in the extreme; the results of defective reanimation, when lumps of graveyard clay had been galvanised into morbid, unnatural, and brainless motion by various modifications of the vital solution .
in his glance there is not any restless light, and if he ever listens for solemn bells or far elfin horns it is only at night when old dreams are wandering .
then he took me through a door on the left, lighted an oil lamp, and told me to make myself at home .
armitage, hastening into some clothing and rushing across the street and lawn to the college buildings, saw that others were ahead of him; and heard the echoes of a burglar alarm still shrilling from the library .
later a queer boldness and recklessness came into my demeanour, till i unconsciously grew to possess the bearing of a man of the world despite my lifelong seclusion .
elwood scarcely dared to touch him, but gradually the screaming and writhing subsided .
a common white handkerchief found among forest rocks on the hillside beyond cannot be identified as belonging to the missing man .
whether i shall go as he did remains to be seen, for i have learned much now .
and the bearded man again implored me to turn back, but i heeded him not; for from the mists beyond the basalt pillars i fancied there came the notes of singer and lutanist; sweeter than the sweetest songs of sona nyl, and sounding mine own praises; the praises of me, who had voyaged far under the full moon and dwelt in the land of fancy .
my father secured me a place in an insurance office, and i buried myself in routine as deeply as possible .

major sir eric moreland clapham lee, d     .s.o., was the greatest surgeon in our division, and had been hastily assigned to the st. eloi sector when news of the heavy fighting reached headquarters.
then we both tried together, and with exotic drugs courted terrible and forbidden dreams in the tower studio chamber of the old manor house in hoary kent .
there he worked like a butcher in the midst of his gory wares i could never get used to the levity with which he handled and classified certain things .
had they known, the coincidence of names would have brought some drastic and frightened action indeed, might not its limited whispering have precipitated the final riot which erased the roulets from the town?
of genuine blood there was none; only the foetid greenish yellow ichor which trickled along the painted floor beyond the radius of the stickiness, and left a curious discolouration behind it .
at times he actually did perform marvels of surgery for the soldiers; but his chief delights were of a less public and philanthropic kind, requiring many explanations of sounds which seemed peculiar even amidst that babel of the damned .
one evening as i strolled on victoria embankment for some needed air, i saw a black shape obscure one of the reflections of the lamps in the water .
the cracked lips tried to frame words which i could not well understand .

no one, however, had been using the telescope at that instant .

this original correspondence was not preserved, but his notes formed a thorough and really significant digest .
the trunk had moved intelligently; and, unbelievable to relate, we were both sickeningly sure that articulate sounds had come from the detached head as it lay in a shadowy corner of the laboratory .
outwardly he was the same to the last calm, cold, slight, and yellow haired, with spectacled blue eyes and a general aspect of youth which years and fears seemed never to change .
his haousekeeper sally was carryin         ' on fit ter kill she'd jest seed the trees a bendin' beside the rud, an' says they was a kind o' mushy saound, like a elephant puffin' an' treadin', a headin' fer the haouse .
very little time had elapsed before i saw the attempt was not to be a total failure .
the thing itself, however, crowded out all other images at the time .
i barely fancied that as i awoke, a light had been hurriedly extinguished within the sunken sepulchre .
of this infirmity, indeed, i had known before; having heard of it from mr  . pope, who took the trouble to make particular inquiries.
the dirty looking fellow who waited on me had a touch of the staring  ''innsmouth look '', but was quite civil in his way; being perhaps used to the custom of such convivial strangers truckmen, gold buyers, and the like as were occasionally in town .

this was always at night in the day he slept and would admit no one .
he wasn 't strictly human .
it was from kilderry that his father had come, and it was there that he wished to enjoy his wealth among ancestral scenes .
that inspector 's story must have worked on my imagination more deeply than i had suspected .
and before he died, taran ish had scrawled upon the altar of chrysolite with coarse shaky strokes the sign of doom .
the stench left quickly, but the vegetation never came right again .
this bower was my temple, the fastened door my shrine, and here i would lie outstretched on the mossy ground, thinking strange thoughts and dreaming strange dreams .
thar     's his head on thet bench, with one arm side of it, an' t'other arm's on the graound side o' the meat block . ''
briden 's death reveals no apparent cause, and was probably due to excitement or exposure .
don 't ask me what it is they see .

later i must have dropped asleep again, for it was out of a phantasmal chaos that my mind leaped when the night grew hideous with shrieks beyond anything in my former experience or imagination .
without having any exact knowledge of geology, i had from the first been interested in the odd mounds and hummocks of the region .
no sane person had even seen it, and few had ever felt it definitely .
in another week the burgomaster decided to overcome his fears and call at the strangely silent dwelling as a matter of duty, though in so doing he was careful to take with him shang the blacksmith and thul the cutter of stone as witnesses .
we met no person, and as time passed the lighted windows became fewer and fewer .
but west 's gentle enemies were no less harassed with prostrating duties .
nobody cud git aout o   ' them whar they got all the stuff, an' all the other natives wondered haow they managed to find fish in plenty even when the very next islands had lean pickin's .
it is natural that such a thing as a dead man 's scream should give horror, for it is obviously not a pleasing or ordinary occurrence; but i was used to similar experiences, hence suffered on this occasion only because of a particular circumstance .
might not the deeper inquiries of my uncle after encountering the sculptor 's data have come to sinister ears?
the hour was one of approaching triumph, for was not my fellow being escaping at last from a degrading periodic bondage; escaping forever, and preparing to follow the accursed oppressor even unto the uttermost fields of ether, that upon it might be wrought a flaming cosmic vengeance which would shake the spheres?
the men, busy with labour, waxed prosperous and as happy as they knew how to be .

it is palpably a part of the valley wall, though how the vast interior was ever excavated i cannot imagine .

with new vigour i applied myself to my examination of the old chateau and its contents .
seeking shelter from the increasing rainfall beneath one of the few undestroyed frye outbuildings, they debated the wisdom of waiting, or of taking the aggressive and going down into the glen in quest of their nameless, monstrous quarry .
excavation was much easier than i expected, though at one point i encountered a queer interruption; when a lean vulture darted down out of the cold sky and pecked frantically at the grave earth until i killed him with a blow of my spade .
innsmouth itself was left almost depopulated, and is even now only beginning to shew signs of a sluggishly revived existence .
zadok was shewing signs of fright and exhaustion, and i let him keep silence for a while, though glancing apprehensively at my watch .
and among the dead faces was the living, mocking face of the youth with the ivory image .
in odd contrast to the tiara 's aspect was its brief and prosy history as related by miss tilton .
i had noticed that they were pretty widely distributed around tempest mountain, though less numerous on the plain than near the hill top itself, where prehistoric glaciation had doubtless found feebler opposition to its striking and fantastic caprices .
as they reached the broad open space where i had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlit water i could see them plainly only a block away and was horrified by the bestial abnormality of their faces and the dog like sub humanness of their crouching gait .
on this deep bony layer rested a knife of great size, obvious antiquity, and grotesque, ornate, and exotic design above which the debris was piled .
tillinghast was grinning repulsively at the revolver which i had almost unconsciously drawn, but from his expression i was sure he had seen and heard as much as i, if not a great deal more .
also, he thinks some of the folks looks durned queer even fer kanakys .
his blue eyes were bulging, glassy, and sightless, and the frantic playing had become a blind, mechanical, unrecognisable orgy that no pen could even suggest .
still too dazed to cry out, he plunged recklessly down the noisome staircase and into the mud outside; halting only when seized and choked by the waiting black man .
when i think of the extent of all that may be brooding down there i almost wish to kill myself forthwith .
my father, his face lined with sorrow, stood by as i shouted my demands to be laid within the tomb; frequently admonishing my captors to treat me as gently as they could .
i heard the phial break harmlessly against the stones of the passage as the tunic of the strange man caught fire and lit the horrid scene with a ghastly radiance .

when sir robert jermyn emerged from his library he left behind the strangled corpse of the explorer, and before he could be restrained, had put an end to all three of his children; the two who were never seen, and the son who had run away .
i can recall the scene now the desolate, pitch black garret studio under the eaves with the rain beating down; the ticking of the lone clock; the fancied ticking of our watches as they rested on the dressing table; the creaking of some swaying shutter in a remote part of the house; certain distant city noises muffled by fog and space; and worst of all the deep, steady, sinister breathing of my friend on the couch a rhythmical breathing which seemed to measure moments of supernal fear and agony for his spirit as it wandered in spheres forbidden, unimagined, and hideously remote .
that last scare had come while i was reaching to uncurl it, and it seems i had vacantly crumpled it into my pocket .
ceasing my futile and now objectless writhing, i watched the spectators as they viewed the treasure trove, and was permitted to share in their discoveries .
he cut himself off hurriedly, and no amount of persuasion or subtlety could elicit more in this direction .
there are not many persons who know what wonders are opened to them in the stories and visions of their youth; for when as children we listen and dream, we think but half formed thoughts, and when as men we try to remember, we are dulled and prosaic with the poison of life .
the only thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly; imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth folk as best i could, and trusting that no one or at least no pursuer of mine would be there .
god knows, though, that the prosy tale which george birch 's death permits me to tell has in it aspects beside which some of our darkest tragedies are light .
all the terror i had dimly felt before rushed upon me actively and vividly, and i knew that i loathed the ancient and abhorrent creature so near me with an infinite intensity .
shrouded in mist they were, so that no man might peer beyond them or see their summits which indeed some say reach even to the heavens .
and the bearded man made enigmatical gestures of prayer, and lit tall candles in curiously wrought brass candlesticks .
it was in those college days that he had begun his terrible experiments, first on small animals and then on human bodies shockingly obtained .
many days they travelled, and from afar saw lofty hatheg kla with his aureole of mournful mist .
    ''when a gen'l'man wants tuh take a drink here, by god, he shall, without you interferin' .
later i told harris only through sheer necessity, and because he had heard odd tales from old people which disposed him ever so little toward belief .
his ears were ringing horribly, as if with the residual echoes of some horrible noise heard in dreams .
but johansen had not given out yet .
kuranes was now very anxious to return to minaret studded celephaïs, and increased his doses of drugs; but eventually he had no more money left, and could buy no drugs .
barzai was wise in the lore of earth 's gods, and listened hard for certain sounds, but atal felt the chill of the vapours and the awe of the night, and feared much .
i heard zann stumble to the window and close both shutter and sash, then stumble to the door, which he falteringly unfastened to admit me .
it might be in the visible world, yet it might be only in his mind and soul .
i knew that i could not accost him then and there, for the firemen would surely notice and object .

moreover, to this day the people of ulthar and nir and hatheg fear eclipses, and pray by night when pale vapours hide the mountain top and the moon .
and yet as one reared in the best kultur of prussia i should not have been amazed, for geology and tradition alike tell us of great transpositions in oceanic and continental areas .
i did not like everything about what i saw, and felt again the fear i had had .
and the tomb where you put those bones, and the other grave without an inscription the whole thing must be a bit terrible . ''
gilman 's handling of this theme filled everyone with admiration, even though some of his hypothetical illustrations caused an increase in the always plentiful gossip about his nervous and solitary eccentricity .
south of the village one may still spy the cellar walls and chimney of the ancient bishop house, which was built before ; whilst the ruins of the mill at the falls, built in , form the most modern piece of architecture to be seen .
in the days of my grandfather there were many; in the days of my father not so many; and now there are so few that i sometimes feel strangely alone, as though i were the last man on our planet .
the thing which had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore; an almost exact duplicate of the one miss tilton had shewn me the previous evening .
at the y     .m.c.a., where i was stopping, the clerk merely discouraged my going to such a dismal, decadent place; and the people at the library shewed much the same attitude.
all day i forged steadily westward, guided by a far away hummock which rose higher than any other elevation on the rolling desert .
and over all rose thoughts and fears which centred in the youth from the sea and the ivory image whose carving was duplicated on the frieze and columns of the temple before me .
an increasing and unexplained atmosphere of panic seemed to rise around his apartment .
tucked obscurely away in a corner of the arkham advertiser was a facetious little item from the associated press, telling what a record breaking monster the bootleg whiskey of dunwich had raised up .
it undulated too much, and glistened too brightly in the rays of the now westering moon .

entering, i began to use my flashlight, and was almost knocked down by the cloud of bats that flapped past me .
loathsomeness waits and dreams in the deep, and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men .
previously indifferent to such things, i had now an unspeakable horror of them; and would retire to the innermost recesses of the house whenever the heavens threatened an electrical display .
then came the steady rattling at the back door .
rushing through the newly opened connexion, i succeeded in bolting the northerly hall door before the lock could be turned; but even as i did so i heard the hall door of the third room the one from whose window i had hoped to reach the roof below being tried with a pass key .
once i thrust a candle within the nearly closed entrance, but could see nothing save a flight of damp stone steps leading downward .
despite weakness, hunger, horror, and bewilderment i found myself after a long time able to walk; so started slowly along the muddy road to rowley .
the fear, however, is an old tradition throughout the neighbouring villages; since it is a prime topic in the simple discourse of the poor mongrels who sometimes leave their valleys to trade hand woven baskets for such primitive necessities as they cannot shoot, raise, or make .
on may eve of there were tremors which even the aylesbury people felt, whilst the following hallowe   'en produced an underground rumbling queerly synchronised with bursts of flame  ''them witch whateleys' doin's '' from the summit of sentinel hill .
idle folk, indeed, said that kalos conversed with the spirits of the grove, and that his statues were but images of the fauns and dryads he met there for he patterned his work after no living model .
then he handed the instrument to morgan, whose sight was keener .
so i read again that hideous chapter, and shuddered doubly because it was indeed not new to me .
no longer could he share the peculiarities and prejudices of the martenses, while the very mountain thunderstorms failed to intoxicate him as they had before .
neither he nor his son archer knew of the shunned house as other than a nuisance almost impossible to rent perhaps on account of the mustiness and sickly odour of unkempt old age .
then men in olive drab came, bearing muskets; till it seemed as if in its sad sleep the street must have some haunting dreams of those other days, when musket bearing men in conical hats walked along it from the woodland spring to the cluster of houses by the beach .
both, though, agreed that they must leave this ancient and accursed house as soon as it could be arranged .
old bugs himself seemed also to belong to the past, for his nondescript clothing bore every hallmark of antiquity .
it is not reassuring to see, on a closer glance, that most of the houses are deserted and falling to ruin, and that the broken steepled church now harbours the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet .
had he signed the black man 's book after all?
there had been soft talking, too and as he began to describe it his voice had sunk to an inaudible whisper .
there were rumblings under the hills that night, and the whippoorwills piped threateningly .
all traces of strange dreaming had vanished with his recovery, and my uncle kept no record of his night thoughts after a week of pointless and irrelevant accounts of thoroughly usual visions .
in the small hours of that night he slept a little in an easy chair in his office, but was at the manuscript again before dawn .
he must ask frank elwood for help .
when the stars were right, they could plunge from world to world through the sky; but when the stars were wrong, they could not live .
the steps creaked, but seemed tolerably sound; and i raced down past a barn like second story to the ground floor .
below the waist, though, it was the worst; for here all human resemblance left off and sheer phantasy began .
actually, the horrified pause of the men was of comparatively brief duration .
some instinct warned armitage that what was taking place was not a thing for unfortified eyes to see, so he brushed back the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door .
he had, though, heard the french canadian who lodged just under gilman talking to mazurewicz one evening .
i saw from the beginning that he was both interested and sympathetic, and when i had finished he analysed and discussed the thing with the greatest shrewdness and judgment .
day after day and night after night did we sail, and when the moon was full we would listen to soft songs of the oarsmen, sweet as on that distant night when we sailed away from my far native land .
johansen 's voyage had begun just as he told it to the vice admiralty .
piles of moss covered stones near the water promised tolerable seats, and the scene was sheltered from all possible view by a ruined warehouse on the north .
          ''it's a goin' agin, an' this time by day it's aout it's aout an' a movin' this very minute, an' only the lord knows when it'll be on us all '' the speaker panted into silence, but another took up his message .
she certainly knew nothing about it .
it had already begun as soon as wilbur was born, when one of the many tool sheds had been put suddenly in order, clapboarded, and fitted with a stout fresh lock .
all were afoot save libo, balbutius, asellius, two or three of the centuriones, and myself, and at length the way became so steep and narrow that those who had horses were forced to leave them; a squad of ten men being left to guard them, though robber bands were not likely to be abroad on such a night of terror .
i was by this time thankfully certain that the railway itself was not patrolled .
awed, shaken, and portentous, my friend who had been beyond the barrier warned me that we must never venture within those realms again .
the box held only a queer parchment whose characters no linguist or palaeographer has been able to decipher or identify .

     ''an' then she let aout a turrible yell, an' says the shed daown the rud had jest caved in like the storm hed blowed it over, only the wind wa'n't strong enough to dew that .
but then the blow fell .
the few callers at the house would often find lavinia alone on the ground floor, while odd cries and footsteps resounded in the boarded up second story .
his mania shewed itself only in his tight boarding up of all the windows in the reclaimed section though many declared that it was a crazy thing to bother with the reclamation at all .
in a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of perhaps an acre 's extent, clear of trees and tolerably dry .
he dropped them all years ago, and no one feels sure whether he left the country or merely sank from sight in some hidden byway .
many covered their eyes with their hands, and plunged blindly and awkwardly in their race to escape; overturning furniture and stumbling against the walls before they managed to reach one of the many doors .
later the god and the princess had returned, and upon the death of the princess her divine husband had mummified the body and enshrined it in a vast house of stone, where it was worshipped .
for several days they glided undulatingly over the water, till finally they came to the horizon, where the sea meets the sky .
as a result, these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent .
very nervously he watched that narrow oaken gate in the high and ivy clad stone wall .
friends and companions he shuns, for he wishes to answer no questions .
many times i walked through that valley, and longer and longer would i pause in the spectral half light where the giant trees squirmed and twisted grotesquely, and the grey ground stretched damply from trunk to trunk, sometimes disclosing the mould stained stones of buried temples .
we shall meet again perhaps in the shining mists of orion 's sword, perhaps on a bleak plateau in prehistoric asia .
at one time johnson recited to me some lines by a servant to the duke of leeds, which had so amus 'd him, that he had got them by heart .
of the six men who never reached the ship, he thinks two perished of pure fright in that accursed instant .
as i approached the arch i began to perceive the presence more clearly; and then, with the first and last sound i ever uttered a ghastly ululation that revolted me almost as poignantly as its noxious cause i beheld in full, frightful vividness the inconceivable, indescribable, and unmentionable monstrosity which had by its simple appearance changed a merry company to a herd of delirious fugitives .
the man was great i say it even now, knowing as much as i do .
our alarm was now divided, for besides our fear of the unknown, we had always entertained a dread that our grisly collection might be discovered .
the figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close and careful study, was between seven and eight inches in height, and of exquisitely artistic workmanship .
it was, the professor stated, a very crude bas relief of stone, comprising a hideous picture and some cryptic writing .
for centuries its lofty battlements have frowned down upon the wild and rugged countryside about, serving as a home and stronghold for the proud house whose honoured line is older even than the moss grown castle walls .
then a faint clicking came from the instrument, and i called down to my friend in a tense voice .
but still i read more in hidden, forgotten books and scrolls to which my new vision led me and pushed through fresh gateways of space and being and life patterns toward the core of the unknown cosmos .
i told him that i could, and translated for his benefit a paragraph near the beginning .
go thou then to athok the cobbler or be gone out of the city by sunset .
it is the land of hope, and in it shine the perfect ideals of all that we know elsewhere; or at least so men relate .
i will repeat here what he said, underlining the words he emphasised:  ''he is calling he is calling i hear him we must go '' as he spoke he took his ivory image from the table, pocketed it, and seized my arm in an effort to drag me up the companionway to the deck .
the final conclusion of the linguists was that the text represented an artificial alphabet, giving the effect of a cipher; though none of the usual methods of cryptographic solution seemed to furnish any clue, even when applied on the basis of every tongue the writer might conceivably have used .
we got all kinds here reel life an ' a good time .
my room, a dismal rear one with two windows and bare, cheap furnishings, overlooked a dingy courtyard otherwise hemmed in by low, deserted brick blocks, and commanded a view of decrepit westward stretching roofs with a marshy countryside beyond .
i scraped further, and saw that it had form .
divorced from the enlightenment of civilisation, the strength of these puritans turned into singular channels; and in their isolation, morbid self repression, and struggle for life with relentless nature, there came to them dark furtive traits from the prehistoric depths of their cold northern heritage .
my friend said they were horrible and impressive beyond my most fevered imaginings; that what was thrown on a screen in the darkened room prophesied things none but nyarlathotep dared prophesy, and that in the sputter of his sparks there was taken from men that which had never been taken before yet which shewed only in the eyes .
as it was, lacking their original letters, i half suspected the compiler of having asked leading questions, or of having edited the correspondence in corroboration of what he had latently resolved to see .
at length, after temporarily felling one of his detainers with a sudden blow, he had flung himself upon the other in a daemoniac ecstasy of bloodthirstiness, shrieking fiendishly that he would   'jump high in the air and burn his way through anything that stopped him' .
behind the figure was a vague suggestion of a cyclopean architectural background .
that these secrets should be brought to light seemed injudicious, and i began to wish for an excuse to leave the castle and the village .
i  've seen wilbur whateley's diary and read some of the strange old books he used to read; and i think i know the right kind of spell to recite to make the thing fade away .

only his lividly inclined complexion and coldness of touch could have afforded a physical basis for this feeling, and even these things should have been excusable considering the man 's known invalidism .
the skin was thickly covered with coarse black fur, and from the abdomen a score of long greenish grey tentacles with red sucking mouths protruded limply .
around that head it closed, totally swallowing it up, and in another moment it had begun to recede; bearing away its invisible burden without touching me, and flowing again out of that black doorway and down the unseen stairs, which creaked as before, though in reverse order .
i felt subtly that the apartment of this ancient victim was best for my purposes .
finally the connecting door gave, but with such a crash that i knew those outside must have heard .
shortly afterward the pale faced workmen apprised the superintendent of their failure .
there was the immemorial figure of the deputy or messenger of hidden and terrible powers the  ''black man '' of the witch cult, and the  ''nyarlathotep '' of the necronomicon .
outside, the moon played on the ridgepole of the block below, and i saw that the jump would be desperately hazardous because of the steep surface on which i must land .
heaven be thanked for the instinct which led me unconscious to places where men dwell; to the peaceful village that slept under the calm stars of clearing skies .
the pequots, enfeebled by a previous war, could give the now stricken narragansetts no assistance; and in a dutch fur trader of albany, petrus van schaack, secured the distinguished cranium for the modest sum of two guilders, he having recognised its value from the half effaced inscription carved in lombardic minuscules palaeography, it might be explained, was one of the leading accomplishments of new netherland fur traders of the seventeenth century .
all was as of old, nor were the marble walls discoloured, nor the polished bronze statues upon them tarnished .
ye see, they was able to live both in an  ' aout o' water what they call amphibians, i guess .
how could he keep himself from going?
for them are the catacombs of ptolemais, and the carven mausolea of the nightmare countries .
he clearly understood my needs at a glance, and ministered to them with a master 's deftness; the while reassuring me in a finely modulated though oddly hollow and timbreless voice that he was the bitterest of sworn enemies to death, and had sunk his fortune and lost all his friends in a lifetime of bizarre experiment devoted to its bafflement and extirpation .
it might be actively hostile, or it might be dictated merely by blind motives of self preservation .
throughout that afternoon they rode around dunwich; questioning the natives concerning all that had occurred, and seeing for themselves with rising pangs of horror the drear frye ruins with their lingering traces of the tarry stickiness, the blasphemous tracks in the frye yard, the wounded seth bishop cattle, and the enormous swaths of disturbed vegetation in various places .
then donovan felt over it delicately around the edge, pressing each point separately as he went .
on the far, misty horizon i could just make out the dizzy profile of the head, topped by the queer ancient house of which so many legends are told; but for the moment all my attention was captured by the nearer panorama just below me .
lying on its side for it could not stand up alone was the exotic spiky figure which in his monstrous dream he had broken off the fantastic balustrade .
he had grown as large as a child of four, and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker .
it seemed, in any event, to be contagious; for hannah bowen, one of the two servants, died of it in the following june .
then we reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond, where the manuxet joins the sea just north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in kingsport head and veer off toward cape ann .
it  's all the same now, for he's gone back into the fabulous darkness he loved to haunt .
if it had only snarled, or bayed, or laughed titteringly even that would have relieved the abysmal hideousness .
he had shewn little regret when shut into the barred room at huntingdon, for his mind moved curiously .
at that moment, as i say, i was elated with the conviction that the one great goal had been attained; and that for the first time a reanimated corpse had uttered distinct words impelled by actual reason .
in auckland i learned that johansen had returned with yellow hair turned white after a perfunctory and inconclusive questioning at sydney, and had thereafter sold his cottage in west street and sailed with his wife to his old home in oslo .
finally i hired a seedy looking loafer whom i encountered on the corner of eighth avenue to keep the patient supplied with ice from a little shop where i introduced him, and applied myself diligently to the task of finding a pump piston and engaging workmen competent to install it .
then the glass broke shiveringly under the persistent impacts, and the chill wind rushed in, making the candles sputter and rustling the sheets of paper on the table where zann had begun to write out his horrible secret .
i was almost paralysed, but not too much so to make a feeble effort toward flight; a backward stumble which failed to break the spell in which the nameless, voiceless monster held me .
and pickman had it as no man ever had it before or i hope to heaven ever will again .
what would the storm call forth or was there anything left for it to call?
among the animals in the exhibition with which he travelled was a huge bull gorilla of lighter colour than the average; a surprisingly tractable beast of much popularity with the performers .
his name was barzai the wise, and the villagers tell of how he went up a mountain on the night of the strange eclipse .
my stricken friend moved them to no pity, but what they found on the couch in the studio made them give me a praise which sickened me, and now a fame which i spurn in despair as i sit for hours, bald, grey bearded, shrivelled, palsied, drug crazed, and broken, adoring and praying to the object they found .
half unconscious, i opened the grating and staggered out upon the white gravel path that stretched away in two directions .
what do moderns know of life and the forces behind it?
the clergymen or priests, or whatever they were called nowadays also wore this kind of ornament as a head dress; but one seldom caught glimpses of them .
and some were strangely robed    . . .
       ''git aout o' here git aout o' here they seen us git aout fer your life dun't wait fer nothin' they know naow run fer it quick aout o' this taown  '' another heavy wave dashed against the loosening masonry of the bygone wharf, and changed the mad ancient's whisper to another inhuman and blood curdling scream .
shortly afterward i was taken through those antique ways so dear to my fancy narrow, curving alleys and passages where rows of red georgian brick blinked with small paned dormers above pillared doorways that had looked on gilded sedans and panelled coaches and in the first flush of realisation of these long wished things i thought i had indeed achieved such treasures as would make me in time a poet .
then i thought with renewed force of what the factory inspector had heard in the night in this mouldering and pestilential building .
he worked largely by feeling now, since newly gathered clouds hid the moon; and though progress was still slow, he felt heartened at the extent of his encroachments on the top and bottom of the aperture .
all at once the head turned sharply in my direction and the eyes fell open, causing me to stare in blank amazement at what i beheld .
the immediate problem was how to reach the ancient railway; and i now saw that the safest course was ahead to babson street, then west to lafayette there edging around but not crossing an open space homologous to the one i had traversed and subsequently back northward and westward in a zigzagging line through lafayette, bates, adams, and bank streets the latter skirting the river gorge to the abandoned and dilapidated station i had seen from my window .
nevertheless there is an ancient house on that cliff, and at evening men see lights in the small paned windows .
for a long hour the watchers gazed, whilst the vapours swirled and the screen of clouds grew thicker and more restless .
the natives, all of whom had talked with the policemen, seemed at first as perplexed as armitage and his companions .
my informant had noticed it many times, and had heard it spoken of as coming from some secret hoard, either of pirates or of daemons .
his interest gradually veered away from the unplumbed voids beyond the slanting surfaces, since it now appeared that the purpose of those surfaces concerned the side he was already on .
the column seemed very thin indeed as it plodded dreamily into the gulf .
the small paned windows were largely broken, and a nameless air of desolation hung round the precarious panelling, shaky interior shutters, peeling wall paper, falling plaster, rickety staircases, and such fragments of battered furniture as still remained .
i repeat to you, gentlemen, that your inquisition is fruitless .
then he commenced whispering as in awe:  ''el ritmo, señor el ritmo de la tierra that throb down in the ground '' and now i also heard; heard and shivered and without knowing why .
for now, when the wind sweeps boisterous out of the north past the high ancient house that is one with the firmament, there is broken at last that ominous brooding silence ever before the bane of kingsport 's maritime cotters .
cap  'n ebenezer holt traded me thet in 'sixty eight him as was kilt in the war . ''
in time he grew so impatient of the bleak intervals of day that he began buying drugs in order to increase his periods of sleep .
noiseless infinity eddied around the dreamer and wafted him away without even touching the body that leaned stiffly from the lonely window; and for days not counted in men 's calendars the tides of far spheres bare him gently to join the dreams for which he longed; the dreams that men have lost .
each transmitted idea formed rapidly in my mind, and though no actual language was employed, my habitual association of conception and expression was so great that i seemed to be receiving the message in ordinary english .
this morning the strange pulls from space seemed lessened, though they were replaced by another sensation even more inexplicable .
then, from the farthermost regions of remoteness, the sound softly glided into existence .
an ' gawd in heaven that haff face on top   . .
it was not long before i found that zann 's eagerness for my company was not as great as it had seemed while he was persuading me to move down from the fifth story .
and the king bade him put away his tattered purple, and clothed him in satin and cloth of gold, with rings of green jade and bracelets of tinted ivory, and lodged him in a gilded and tapestried chamber on a bed of sweet carven wood with canopies and coverlets of flower embroidered silk .
the professors at miskatonic had urged him to slacken up, and had voluntarily cut down his course at several points .
the young gentleman had better be sure to wear the crucifix joe mazurewicz had given him .
amidst this elysian realm i dwelt not as a stranger, for each sight and sound was familiar to me; just as it had been for uncounted aeons of eternity before, and would be for like eternities to come .
that is why i continued to feel that wilcox, somehow cognisant of the old data which my uncle had possessed, had been imposing on the veteran scientist .
 ''used to be talk of a queer foreign kind of jewellery that the sailors and refinery men sometimes sold on the sly, or that was seen once or twice on some of the marsh womenfolks .
then the doctor came with his medicine case and asked crisp questions, and removed the patient 's outer clothing, shoes, and socks .
the marshy region began very shortly, with the single track on a low, grassy embankment where the weedy growth was somewhat thinner .
saturday the th i spent in total darkness, tormented by thoughts and memories that threatened to overcome my german will .
i was sorry when i saw that there would be no other passengers on the bus .
at the end of the cut it would cross the track and swerve off to a safer distance; but meanwhile i must be exceedingly careful .
i thought, too, of those nameless swimmers i had seen .
toward the middle of the next night he drowsed off in his chair, but soon woke out of a tangle of nightmares almost as hideous as the truths and menaces to man 's existence that he had uncovered .
i screamed aloud that i was not afraid; that i never could be afraid; and others screamed with me for solace .
and when they were come into the town they found rose wreathed revellers bound from house to house and leaning from windows and balconies, who listened to the songs of iranon and tossed him flowers and applauded when he was done .
a sandy tongue had formed inside this barrier, and upon it i saw a few decrepit cabins, moored dories, and scattered lobster pots .
the vault to which i refer is of ancient granite, weathered and discoloured by the mists and dampness of generations .
from such books i learned all that i know .
now he seemed to sense the close presence of some terrible part of the intruding horror, and to glimpse a hellish advance in the black dominion of the ancient and once passive nightmare .
it was their changeling and in a spirit of supreme irony pickman had given the features a very perceptible resemblance to his own .
two biological points he was exceedingly anxious to settle first, whether any amount of consciousness and rational action be possible without the brain, proceeding from the spinal cord and various nerve centres; and second, whether any kind of ethereal, intangible relation distinct from the material cells may exist to link the surgically separated parts of what has previously been a single living organism .
in the end the three men from arkham old, white bearded dr   . armitage, stocky, iron grey professor rice, and lean, youngish dr. morgan ascended the mountain alone.
the officials devised excuses not to enter the noisome boarded place; and were glad to confine their survey of the deceased 's living quarters, the newly mended sheds, to a single visit .
everything was wrong, with the broad window shewing a sea of roofs in which only about one in five was ancient, and the sound of trolleys and motors in the streets below .
when we did turn, it was to climb through the deserted length of the oldest and dirtiest alley i ever saw in my life, with crumbling looking gables, broken small paned windows, and archaic chimneys that stood out half disintegrated against the moonlit sky .
scenes were blocked out with extreme care, and pencilled guide lines told of the minute exactitude which pickman used in getting the right perspective and proportions .
the remaining two had gone back wordlessly to their mountains and this autumn not a single villager had disappeared .
but still there remained that burning determination to reach the innermost secret of the fear, which i had once more come to deem definite, material, and organic .
 ''can you dare you go far? ''
louis, son to robert, was found drowned in the moat at the same fateful age, and thus down through the centuries ran the ominous chronicle; henris, roberts, antoines, and armands snatched from happy and virtuous lives when little below the age of their unfortunate ancestor at his murder .
out of that crash came darkness, and i heard the shrieking of men and of things which were not men .
several times he had actually obtained signs of life in animals supposedly dead; in many cases violent signs; but he soon saw that the perfection of this process, if indeed possible, would necessarily involve a lifetime of research .
his condition was more ghastly .
the eyes approached, yet of the thing that bore them i could distinguish only a claw .
i cannot even hint what it was like, for it was a compound of all that is unclean, uncanny, unwelcome, abnormal, and detestable .
they had talked about dying and half deserted innsmouth for nearly a century, and nothing new could be wilder or more hideous than what they had whispered and hinted years before .
at length i reached the lower hall, at one end of which i saw a faint luminous rectangle marking the ruined paine street doorway .
at the hospital they told me i had been found half frozen in kingsport harbour at dawn, clinging to the drifting spar that accident sent to save me .
at the college we used an incinerator, but the apparatus was too costly for our unauthorised laboratory .
trembling with a terror oddly mixed with ecstasy i crossed the circular room to the north window from which i could see the village and the plain at the edge of the bog .
in the evening they drowsily discussed the mathematical studies which had so completely and perhaps harmfully engrossed gilman, and speculated about the linkage with ancient magic and folklore which seemed so darkly probable .
blue, green, grey, white, or black; smooth, ruffled, or mountainous; that ocean is not silent .
the latter, he had said, was the daughter of a portuguese trader whom he had met in africa; and did not like english ways .
now he felt that he must go north infinitely north .
i had never, seemingly, heard human speech before; and could guess only vaguely what was said .
west and i had met in college, and i had been the only one to sympathise with his hideous experiments .
many would have disliked to live if possessed of the peculiar features of arthur jermyn, but he had been a poet and scholar and had not minded .
and the day wore on, and still olney listened to rumours of old times and far places, and heard how the kings of atlantis fought with the slippery blasphemies that wriggled out of rifts in ocean 's floor, and how the pillared and weedy temple of poseidonis is still glimpsed at midnight by lost ships, who know by its sight that they are lost .
but it cast a shadow of myself and the cot on the floor, and had a yellowish, penetrating force that hinted at things more potent than luminosity .
i had been on a long visit to my parents in illinois, and upon my return found west in a state of singular elation .
when i finally found myself adrift and free, i had but little idea of my surroundings .
there had been a strange kidnapping the night before in orne 's gangway, and the two year old child of a clod like laundry worker named anastasia wolejko had completely vanished from sight .
the vault had been dug from a hillside, so that the narrow ventilation funnel in the top ran through several feet of earth, making this direction utterly useless to consider .
gradually i came to wonder what might be my place in that city on the strange plateau betwixt strange peaks .
i knew we must have passed down through the mountain and beneath the earth of kingsport itself, and i shivered that a town should be so aged and maggoty with subterraneous evil .
for a second nobody dared to turn on the light, then armitage summoned up his courage and snapped the switch .
in either case it would have been appropriate; for the unexpected tenacity of the easy looking brickwork was surely a sardonic commentary on the vanity of mortal hopes, and the source of a task whose performance deserved every possible stimulus .
then thought trickled back, and i knew that i had witnessed things more horrible than i had dreamed .
but repugnance was soon forgotten in admiration, for the strange physician 's extreme skill at once became manifest despite the ice coldness and shakiness of his bloodless looking hands .
this worry had probably been a major cause of his mother 's death two years before .
beyond the worlds vague ghosts of monstrous things; half seen columns of unsanctified temples that rest on nameless rocks beneath space and reach up to dizzy vacua above the spheres of light and darkness .
and the children would listen, and learn of the laws and deeds of old, and of that dear england which they had never seen, or could not remember .
on spring evenings it would be low in the northeast .
they had not seen it, but had heard such cries from one of their hamlets that they knew a creeping death had come .
i was between my two companions, george bennett being toward the window and william tobey toward the fireplace .
the street lights we first encountered had been of oil, and of the ancient lozenge pattern .
and so they went up wildly over rocks and gulfs, slipping and stumbling, and sometimes awed at the vastness and horrible silence of bleak ice pinnacles and mute granite steeps .
may i say that he flouted the sanctity of things as great as space and time, and that he put to strange uses the rites of sartain half breed red indians once encamped upon this hill?
the sorry planet shell being well nigh spent, in less than an hour my fellow would be free to pursue the oppressor along the milky way and past the hither stars to the very confines of infinity .
   ''but the real thing behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudice and i don't say i'm blaming those that hold it .
i was now shaking with a deadly fear, and the bearded man almost had to hold me up as he walked me across the room to the mirror, the faint lamp i   .e., that formerly on the table, not the still fainter lantern he had brought in his free hand.
in appearance all were marked by a peculiar inherited dissimilarity of eyes; one generally being blue and the other brown .
accordingly i continued my experiments, though informing no one of their nature .
the strange stone house on the woodland slope was to me only a source of interest and speculation; and its cold, damp interior, into which i vainly peered through the aperture so tantalisingly left, contained for me no hint of death or decay .
but not many flags floated over the street, for therein brooded only fear and hatred and ignorance .
by the fourth evening i attained the base of the mound, which turned out to be much higher than it had appeared from a distance; an intervening valley setting it out in sharper relief from the general surface .
there was something there and now i can 't use the subway or and you may as well have your laugh at this, too go down into cellars any more .
  ''nor is it to be thought, '' ran the text as armitage mentally translated it,  ''that man is either the oldest or the last of earth's masters, or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone .
so a body of twenty police, filling two carriages and an automobile, had set out in the late afternoon with the shivering squatter as a guide .
i was by this time his active and enthralled assistant, and helped him make all his decisions, not only concerning the source of bodies but concerning a suitable place for our loathsome work .
the more he withdrew from the world about him, the more wonderful became his dreams; and it would have been quite futile to try to describe them on paper .
the dark blocks of granite, the door so curiously ajar, and the funereal carvings above the arch, aroused in me no associations of mournful or terrible character .
i was up ta his haouse onct, on the hill, tradin ' hosses, when i see this book .
the government men never found poor zadok, and have no conjectures to make as to what became of him .
then, in spite of my daze of fright and disgust, my morbid curiosity triumphed; and as the last of the monstrosities oozed up alone from that nether world of unknown nightmare, i drew my automatic pistol and shot it under cover of the thunder .
so liberal, indeed, was the discipline of our captors, that five days after we were taken i managed to escape alone in a small boat with water and provisions for a good length of time .
she seemed to crystallise at a point closer to the ceiling than to the floor, and every night she was a little nearer and more distinct before the dream shifted .
several faces i recognised; though i should have known them better had they been shrivelled or eaten away by death and decomposition .
toward the end of march he began to pick up in his mathematics, though other studies bothered him increasingly .
it was the shrieking fulfilment of all the horror which that corpse city had ever stirred in my soul, and forgetting every injunction to silence i screamed and screamed and screamed as my nerves gave way and the walls quivered about me .
they are grown stern, and where once they suffered men to displace them, they now forbid men to come, or coming, to depart .
this is the last rational act i ever performed .
inside the hall were music, laughter, and wine on every hand .
i had been living in many poor places, always evicted for want of money; until at last i came upon that tottering house in the rue d 'auseil, kept by the paralytic blandot .
as he copied the formula he finally chose, dr  . armitage looked involuntarily over his shoulder at the open pages; the left hand one of which, in the latin version, contained such monstrous threats to the peace and sanity of the world.
upon landing in salem zerubbabel set it up in his cupboard beside the chimney, he having built a modest house near the town pump .
sawyer, as clumsy as most non users of optical devices are, fumbled a while; but eventually focussed the lenses with armitage 's aid .
in my mind i would often picture the unknown land of cathuria with its splendid groves and palaces, and would wonder what new delights there awaited me .
 ''some chicken '' leered a drunken man as he viewed the beautiful face, but those who were sober did not leer, looking with respect and abashment at the delicate and spiritual features .
next there came to me the impression of light amidst the darkness of dead batteries, and i seemed to see a sort of phosphorescent glow in the water through the porthole which opened toward the temple .
this process, however, afforded me no means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon; as i might make its circuit, and return to the point whence i set out, without being aware of the fact; so perfectly uniform seemed the wall .
in his left hand was a gold snuff box, from which, as he capered down the hill, cutting all manner of fantastic steps, he took snuff incessantly with an air of the greatest possible self satisfaction .
the astronomer, perhaps, at this point, took refuge in the suggestion of non luminosity; and here analogy was suddenly let fall .
the surcingle hung in ribands from my body .
i knew that you could not say to yourself   'stereotomy' without being brought to think of atomies, and thus of the theories of epicurus; and since, when we discussed this subject not very long ago, i mentioned to you how singularly, yet with how little notice, the vague guesses of that noble greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular cosmogony, i felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great nebula in orion, and i certainly expected that you would do so .
here we barricaded ourselves, and, for the present were secure .
but a glance will show the fallacy of this idea .
to these speeches they gave, of course, their own interpretation; fancying, no doubt, that at all events i should come into possession of vast quantities of ready money; and provided i paid them all i owed, and a trifle more, in consideration of their services, i dare say they cared very little what became of either my soul or my carcass .
i even went so far as to speak of a slightly hectic cough with which, at one time, i had been troubled of a chronic rheumatism of a twinge of hereditary gout and, in conclusion, of the disagreeable and inconvenient, but hitherto carefully concealed, weakness of my eyes .
now the net work was not permanently fastened to the hoop, but attached by a series of running loops or nooses .
on every hand was a wilderness of balconies, of verandas, of minarets, of shrines, and fantastically carved oriels .
with how deep a spirit of wonder and perplexity was i wont to regard him from our remote pew in the gallery, as, with step solemn and slow, he ascended the pulpit this reverend man, with countenance so demurely benign, with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing, with wig so minutely powdered, so rigid and so vast, could this be he who, of late, with sour visage, and in snuffy habiliments, administered, ferule in hand, the draconian laws of the academy?
these bizarre attempts at explanation were followed by others equally bizarre .
for many prodigies and signs had taken place, and far and wide, over sea and land, the black wings of the pestilence were spread abroad .
all that as yet can fairly be said to be known is, that    'pure gold can be made at will, and very readily from lead in connection with certain other substances, in kind and in proportions, unknown  .' speculation, of course, is busy as to the immediate and ultimate results of this discovery a discovery which few thinking persons will hesitate in referring to an increased interest in the matter of gold generally, by the late developments in california; and this reflection brings us inevitably to another the exceeding inopportuneness of von kempelen's analysis.
i seemed to be upon the verge of comprehension without power to comprehend men, at times, find themselves upon the brink of remembrance without being able, in the end, to remember .
meantime the whole paradise of arnheim bursts upon the view .
  ''the present peculiar condition of affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues in which d is known to be involved, would render the instant availability of the document its susceptibility of being produced at a moment's notice a point of nearly equal importance with its possession . ''
it is not to be supposed, however, that the great underduk suffered this impertinence on the part of the little old man to pass off with impunity .
i need not tell you how sceptical i have hitherto been on the topic of the soul 's immortality .
presently the murmur of water fell gently upon my ear and in a few moments afterward, as i turned with the road somewhat more abruptly than hitherto, i became aware that a building of some kind lay at the foot of a gentle declivity just before me .
ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts lavished upon him by fortune .
i still continued in the plane of the elipse, but made little progress to the eastward .
mein gott do you take me vor a shicken? ''  ''no oh no '' i replied, much alarmed,  ''you are no chicken certainly not . ''
the state rooms were sufficiently roomy, and each had two berths, one above the other .
we suffered no little from cold, and the dampness of the atmosphere was most unpleasant; but the ample space in the car enabled us to lie down, and by means of cloaks and a few blankets, we did sufficiently well .
this gentleman was clothed from head to foot in a richly embroidered black silk velvet pall, wrapped negligently around his form after the fashion of a spanish cloak .
the pigeons appeared distressed in the extreme, and struggled to escape; while the cat mewed piteously, and, with her tongue hanging out of her mouth, staggered to and fro in the car as if under the influence of poison .
i panted i gasped for breath there could be no doubt of the design of my tormentors oh most unrelenting oh most demoniac of men i shrank from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell .
with great difficulty i gained my feet, and looking dizzily around, was, at first, struck with the idea of our being among breakers; so terrific, beyond the wildest imagination, was the whirlpool of mountainous and foaming ocean within which we were engulfed .
how this celebrated magazine can sustain its evidently tremendous expenses, is more than we can understand .
 ''but could not the cavity be detected by sounding? ''

 ''keep up the largest branch the one on this side, '' said legrand .
and quivering awhile among the draperies of the room, it at length rested in full view upon the surface of the door of brass .
matters had now assumed a really serious aspect, and i resolved to call at once upon my particular friend, mr  . theodore sinivate; for i knew that here at least i should get something like definite information.
the system had its disadvantages, and even its dangers .
 ''but, my dear fellow, you are joking then, '' said i,  ''this is a very passable skull indeed, i may say that it is a very excellent skull, according to the vulgar notions about such specimens of physiology and your scarabæus must be the queerest scarabæus in the world if it resembles it .
the ideas of my friend may be summed up in a few words .
i believe i shall be forced to call them both out .
yet all these appearances have been given i beg pardon will be given by the learned of future ages, to the ashimah of the syrians .
 ''i believe, sir, you have forgotten to pay for your brandy and water . ''
there was no advertisement of the picking up of this boat .
  ''but that kidd's accumulations were immense, is well known .
and from their high summits, one by one, drop everlasting dews .
it is indeed demonstrable that every such impulse given the air, must, in the end, impress every individual thing that exists within the universe; and the being of infinite understanding the being whom we have imagined might trace the remote undulations of the impulse trace them upward and onward in their influences upon all particles of an matter upward and onward for ever in their modifications of old forms or, in other words, in their creation of new until he found them reflected unimpressive at last back from the throne of the godhead .
it will be remembered, that, in the earliest stage of my speculations upon the possibility of a passage to the moon, the existence, in its vicinity, of an atmosphere, dense in proportion to the bulk of the planet, had entered largely into my calculations; this too in spite of many theories to the contrary, and, it may be added, in spite of a general disbelief in the existence of any lunar atmosphere at all .
a bear once, attempting to swim from lofoden to moskoe, was caught by the stream and borne down, while he roared terribly, so as to be heard on shore .

  ''pierre moreau, tobacconist, deposes that he has been in the habit of selling small quantities of tobacco and snuff to madame l'espanaye for nearly four years .

it was in the spirit of this wisdom that, among the ancient hebrews, it was believed the gates of heaven would be inevitably opened to that sinner, or saint, who, with good lungs and implicit confidence, should vociferate the word  ''amen '' it was in the spirit of this wisdom that, when a great plague raged at athens, and every means had been in vain attempted for its removal, epimenides, as laertius relates, in his second book, of that philosopher, advised the erection of a shrine and temple  ''to the proper god  . '' lyttleton barry.
i feel confident he never would have dreamed of taking up his residence in alexander the great o nopolis had he been aware that, in alexander the great o nopolis, there lived a gentleman named john smith if i rightly remember, who for many years had there quietly grown fat in editing and publishing the   'alexander the great o nopolis gazette .'
the longer i meditated upon these the more intense grew the interest which had been excited within me .
to add to our dilemma, we found the pumps choked and nearly useless .

his supposition was that  ''a well taught boy very thin and tall of his age sufficiently so that he could be concealed in a drawer almost immediately under the chess board '' played the game of chess and effected all the evolutions of the automaton .
interspersed about the room, crossing and recrossing in endless irregularity, were innumerable benches and desks, black, ancient, and time worn, piled desperately with much bethumbed books, and so beseamed with initial letters, names at full length, grotesque figures, and other multiplied efforts of the knife, as to have entirely lost what little of original form might have been their portion in days long departed .
but these absurdities i must not pause to detail .
scarcely had we recovered our senses, before the foretopsail went into shreds, when we got up a storm stay sail and with this did pretty well for some hours, the ship heading the sea much more steadily than before .

but i shall never forget the emotions of wonder and horror with which i gazed, when, leaping through these windows, and down among us pele mele, fighting, stamping, scratching, and howling, there rushed a perfect army of what i took to be chimpanzees, ourang outangs, or big black baboons of the cape of good hope .
my sentiments were at once quieted and exalted .
i would really give fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter . ''
it was my elder brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for i had made sure that he was overboard but the next moment all this joy was turned into horror for he put his mouth close to my ear, and screamed out the word   'moskoe ström'  ''no one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment .
i went as passenger having no other inducement than a kind of nervous restlessness which haunted me as a fiend .

a youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character that i cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: i have never believed it to be necessary, and when i heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, i felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services .
i confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me .

it was useless to provide many things, for we should find abundant provision in every town .
they fly quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an english stagecoach .

i dared, i conquered them all, till now i have sold myself to death, with the sole condition that thou shouldst follow me fire, and war, and plague, unite for thy destruction o my raymond, there is no safety for thee '' with an heavy heart i listened to the changes of her delirium; i made her a bed of cloaks; her violence decreased and a clammy dew stood on her brow as the paleness of death succeeded to the crimson of fever, i placed her on the cloaks .
the next morning i delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors .
nor did raymond make an end without drawing in vivid and glowing colours, the splendour of a kingdom, in opposition to the commercial spirit of republicanism .
the stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which i had before understood, but i profited by the others .
each people looked on the coming struggle as that which would be to a great degree decisive; as, in case of victory, the next step would be the siege of constantinople by the greeks .
my lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in his profession .

the sky was serene; and, as i was unable to rest, i resolved to visit the spot where my poor william had been murdered .

the ex queen gives me idris; adrian is totally unfitted to succeed to the earldom, and that earldom in my hands becomes a kingdom .

he came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation .
i had expected some extravagant proposition, and remained silent awhile, collecting my thoughts that i might the better combat her fanciful scheme .
they still appeared in public together, and lived under the same roof .
he began to answer with violence:  ''yes, yes, i hate you you are my bane, my poison, my disgust oh no '' and then his manner changed, and fixing his eyes on me with an expression that convulsed every nerve and member of my frame  ''you are none of all these; you are my light, my only one, my life .
besides, perdita was with him in his retirement; she saw the moodiness that succeeded to this forced hilarity; she marked his disturbed sleep, his painful irritability once she had seen his tears hers had scarce ceased to flow, since she had beheld the big drops which disappointed pride had caused to gather in his eye, but which pride was unable to dispel .
i packed up my chemical instruments and the materials i had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of scotland .
my skin was embrowned by the sun; my step was firm with conscious power .
i started forward and exclaimed,  ''villain before you sign my death warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe . ''
he determined to extract and condense all of glory, power, and achievement, which might have resulted from a long reign, into the three years of his protectorate .
they had received orders that if i were again taken, i should be brought to the earl; and his lenity made them expect a conclusion which they considered ill befitting my crime .
six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and i stood in the same place where i had last embraced my father before my departure for ingolstadt .
i had now spent many hours in tears and mournful meditation; it was past twelve o 'clock; all was at peace in the house, and the gentle air that stole in at my window did not rustle the leaves of the twining plants that shadowed it .
look, i weep: for more than two years i have never enjoyed one moment free from anguish .
justine was called on for her defence .
my words flowed spontaneously my utterance was firm and quick .
he obeyed her injunctions, and passed a year in exile in cumberland .
he reverted to his past life, his successes in greece, his favour at home .
i look on the hands which executed the deed; i think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more .
horrible sights were shaped to me in the turbid cloud that hovered over the city; and my only relief was derived from the struggles i made to approach the gate .
i resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated and despised, every country must be equally horrible .
i will protect the first the latter i commit to your charge .
miserable himself that he may render no other wretched, he ought to die .

she often repined; but her trust in the singleness of his affection was undisturbed; and, when they were together, unchecked by fear, she opened her heart to the fullest delight .
he was full of thought, and remained silent during a considerable part of our ride; at length he said,   ''i must apologize to you for my abstraction; the truth is, ryland's motion comes on to night, and i am considering my reply . ''
raymond did not wonder, that, thus situated, the artist had shrunk from notice, but he did not for this alter his resolve .
but while i endured punishment and pain in their defence with the spirit of an hero, i claimed as my reward their praise and obedience .
i must collect my thoughts .
 ''not so, '' said i,  ''though i confess that my thoughts are not occupied as pleasantly as yours are .
 ''surely it is not the custom of englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably . ''
they remained confined for five months before the trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country .
these are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river .
if manly courage and resistance can save us, we will be saved .
the silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love .
i commenced by inuring my body to hardship .
i travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human being .
adrian had introduced systematic modes of proceeding in the metropolis, which, while they were unable to stop the progress of death, yet prevented other evils, vice and folly, from rendering the awful fate of the hour still more tremendous .
the extreme darkness of the stage, whose only light was received from the fire under the cauldron, joined to a kind of mist that floated about it, rendered the unearthly shapes of the witches obscure and shadowy .
for a long time i dared not hope; but when his unobstructed breathing and the moisture that suffused his forehead, were tokens no longer to be mistaken of the departure of mortal malady, i ventured to whisper the news of the change to idris, and at length succeeded in persuading her that i spoke truth .
my first thought was perdita; to her i must return; her i must support, drawing such food from despair as might best sustain her wounded heart; recalling her from the wild excesses of grief, by the austere laws of duty, and the soft tenderness of regret .
he owned affinity not only with mankind, but all nature was akin to him; the mountains and sky were his friends; the winds of heaven and the offspring of earth his playmates; while he the focus only of this mighty mirror, felt his life mingle with the universe of existence .
alfred stood immoveable before him, his whole attention absorbed .
leave me; i am inexorable . ''
i listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply .
you hate me, but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which i regard myself .
he made a vow against love and its train of struggles, disappointment and remorse, and sought in mere sensual enjoyment, a remedy for the injurious inroads of passion .
i provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother, and departed .
i rushed towards the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake .
she might have heard of my return from london, and my visit to bolter 's lock, which, connected with my continued absence, might tend greatly to alarm her .
this man, whose name was beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence .
we found, on each side of the humid pathway,  ''dry land for the sole of the foot . ''
i dare not ask you to do what i think right, for i may still be misled by passion .
since then i must be an object of indifference or contempt to her, better, far better avoid her, nor expose myself before her and the scornful world to the chance of playing the mad game of a fond, foolish icarus .
i shewed her the dangers which her children incurred during her absence; and she at length agreed not to go beyond the inclosure of the forest .
the remains of the half finished creature, whom i had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and i almost felt as if i had mangled the living flesh of a human being .
then again the kindly influence ceased to act i found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection .
his feelings are forever on the stretch; and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties .
 ''the father of safie had been the cause of their ruin .
 ''my children, '' she said,  ''my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union .
i will win him to me; he shall not deny his grief to me and when i know his secret then will i pour a balm into his soul and again i shall enjoy the ravishing delight of beholding his smile, and of again seeing his eyes beam if not with pleasure at least with gentle love and thankfulness .
i soon arrived at the hut: the door was ajar .
for a moment i was almost paralized by fear; but my energy returned and i demanded a guide to accompany me in following his steps .
i could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery .
i remembered in one of her harshest moments a quotation of mine had roused her to anger and disdain .
about two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before night the ice broke and freed our ship .

he found my name a good passport to preferment, and he had procured for me the situation of private secretary to the ambassador at vienna, where i should enter on my career under the best auspices .
but on you only had i any claim for pity and redress, and from you i determined to seek that justice which i vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form .
i strove to think that all this grandeur was but more glaring infamy, and that, by planting his gold enwoven flag beside my tarnished and tattered banner, he proclaimed not his superiority, but his debasement .

everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible .
i gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as i had given to his fellow professor .
as the music went on, my ideas seemed to quit their mortal dwelling house; they shook their pinions and began a flight, sailing on the placid current of thought, filling the creation with new glory, and rousing sublime imagery that else had slept voiceless .
i waited for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed i was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and i saw the superscription of elizabeth or my father, i hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate .
one fine february day, when the sun had reassumed some of its genial power, i walked in the forest with my family .
at this time lord raymond returned from greece .
bread and water did not tame my blood, nor solitary confinement inspire me with gentle thoughts .
i carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity .
the gentle words of agatha and the animated smiles of the charming arabian were not for me .
alas life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated .
i was struck by the improvement that appeared in the health of adrian .
 ''are you better now, sir? '' said she .
another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house; it was not cold .
his appearance, different from any i had ever before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me .
i am thy creature, and i will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me .
nor did i doubt, that in the tranquillity of our family circle at windsor, she would recover some degree of composure, and in the end, of happiness .
no man could crush a  ''butterfly on the wheel '' with better effect; no man better cover a speedy retreat from a powerful adversary .
their still apparent union permitted her to do much; but no woman could, in the end, present a remedy to the encreasing negligence of the protector; who, as if seized with a paroxysm of insanity, trampled on all ceremony, all order, all duty, and gave himself up to license .
the rooks cawed loudly in the trees above; mixed with their hoarse cries i heard a lively strain of music .
no sympathy may i ever find .
i suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for mr  . kirwin hastened to say,  ''immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on your person were brought me, and i examined them that i might discover some trace by which i could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness.
as soon as morning dawned i crept from my kennel, that i might view the adjacent cottage and discover if i could remain in the habitation i had found .
elinor die this is frenzy and the most miserable despair: you cannot die while i am near . ''
our talk was on subjects, unconnected with the emotions that evidently occupied each; but we each divined the other 's thought, and as our voices spoke of indifferent matters, our eyes, in mute language, told a thousand things no tongue could have uttered .
nor did adrian instruct me only in the cold truths of history and philosophy .
   'let me go,' he cried; 'monster ugly wretch you wish to eat me and tear me to pieces .
in the open air alone i found relief; among nature 's beauteous works, her god reassumed his attribute of benevolence, and again i could trust that he who built up the mountains, planted the forests, and poured out the rivers, would erect another state for lost humanity, where we might awaken again to our affections, our happiness, and our faith .
  ''vase am i, '' she thought,  ''vase brimful of despair's direst essence .
he alluded to adrian, and spoke of him with that disparagement that the worldly wise always attach to enthusiasm .
i recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished .
raymond had evidently vacillated during his journey, and irresolution was marked in every gesture as we entered perdita 's cottage .
when my father had arrived the storm had already begun, but he had refused to stop and leaving his horse there he walked on towards the sea .
alas, what will become of us?
 ''the relatives of the earl of windsor, '' said she haughtily,  ''doubtless think that i injured him; perhaps the earl himself would be the first to acquit me, but probably i do not deserve acquittal .
his demeanour was sad; for a moment he appeared glad to see me and then he checked himself as if unwilling to betray his feelings .
the wound, and consequent inability of argyropylo, caused raymond to be the first in command .
i often wished that i had permitted her to take her own course, and engage herself in such labours for the welfare of others as might have distracted her thoughts .
now, beware be silent do not urge me to your destruction .
we went out with the resolution of disputing with our foe .
we will fight the enemy to the last .
i spoke without much heed, and the very conclusion of what i said brought with it other thoughts .
she reposed beside her beloved, and the tomb above was inscribed with the united names of raymond and perdita .
her story was plain to him, plain and distinct as the remorse and horror that darted their fangs into him .
if i wept he would gaze on me in silence but he was no longer harsh and although he repulsed every caress yet it was with gentleness .
these sounds were mingled with the roaring of the sea, the splash of the chafed billows round the vessel 's sides, and the gurgling up of the water in the hold .
but i could discover, amidst all her repinings, deep resentment towards raymond, and an unfading sense of injury, that plucked from me my hope, when i appeared nearest to its fulfilment .
he rode through the town, visiting the wounded, and giving such orders as were necessary for the siege he meditated .
this was not altogether the fact: but predominant self will assumed the arms and masque of callous feeling; and the haughty lady disdained to exhibit any token of the struggle she endured; while the slave of pride, she fancied that she sacrificed her happiness to immutable principle .
i was now in holborn, and passed by a public house filled with uproarious companions, whose songs, laughter, and shouts were more sorrowful than the pale looks and silence of the mourner .
i rambled on, oppressed, distracted by painful emotions suddenly i found myself before drury lane theatre .
excellent friend how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own .
while in london these and many other dreadful thoughts too harrowing for words were my portion: i lost all this suffering when i was free; when i saw the wild heath around me, and the evening star in the west, then i could weep, gently weep, and be at peace .
 ''what can i do? '' she cried,  ''i am lost we are both for ever lost but come come with me, lionel; here i must not stay, we can get a chaise at the nearest post house; yet perhaps we have time come, o come with me to save and protect me '' when i heard her piteous demands, while with disordered dress, dishevelled hair, and aghast looks, she wrung her hands the idea shot across me is she also mad?  ''sweet one, '' and i folded her to my heart,  ''better repose than wander further; rest my beloved, i will make a fire you are chill . ''
my productions however were sufficiently unpretending; they were confined to the biography of favourite historical characters, especially those whom i believed to have been traduced, or about whom clung obscurity and doubt .
but i was enchanted by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as pandemonium appeared to the demons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire .
she received these tokens of returning love with gentleness; she did not shun his company; but she endeavoured to place a barrier in the way of familiar intercourse or painful discussion, which mingled pride and shame prevented raymond from surmounting .
here were the future governors of england; the men, who, when our ardour was cold, and our projects completed or destroyed for ever, when, our drama acted, we doffed the garb of the hour, and assumed the uniform of age, or of more equalizing death; here were the beings who were to carry on the vast machine of society; here were the lovers, husbands, fathers; here the landlord, the politician, the soldier; some fancied that they were even now ready to appear on the stage, eager to make one among the dramatis personae of active life .
evadne, once the idol of adrian 's affections; and who, for the sake of her present visitor, had disdained the noble youth, and then, neglected by him she loved, with crushed hopes and a stinging sense of misery, had returned to her native greece .
but i was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition .
but this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust .
great god if for one instant i had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, i would rather have banished myself forever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage .
in this manner i distributed my occupations when i first arrived, but as i proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me .
such a monster has, then, really existence i cannot doubt it, yet i am lost in surprise and admiration .
it is hard for one so young who was once so happy as i was; sic voluntarily to divest themselves of all sensation and to go alone to the dreary grave; i dare not .
in her resentful mood, these expressions had been remembered with acrimony and disdain; they visited her in her softened hour, taking sleep from her eyes, all hope of rest from her uneasy mind .
god raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst .
give me the name of friend; i will fulfill its duties; and if for a moment complaint and sorrow would shape themselves into words let me be near to speak peace to your vext soul . ''
her manners were cold and repulsive .
she is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as i mentioned before, her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt .
soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my cousin .
we read of centre and wing in greek and roman history; we fancy a spot, plain as a table, and soldiers small as chessmen; and drawn forth, so that the most ignorant of the game can discover science and order in the disposition of the forces .
whisper it not, let the demons hear and rejoice the choice is with us; let us will it, and our habitation becomes a paradise .

he was nearly killed with kindness .
i listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; i expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor, without letting escape inexperience in life would have made me ashamed any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours .
i have consorted long with grief, entered the gloomy labyrinth of madness, and emerged, but half alive .
my life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but i preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path .
some reflection seemed to sting him, and the spasm of pain that for a moment convulsed his countenance, checked my indignation .
the chamber was full but there was no protector; and there was an austere discontent manifest on the countenances of the leaders, and a whispering and busy tattle among the underlings, not less ominous .
justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears .
the landlady met her in the passage; the poor creature asked,  ''is my husband here?

often with maternal affection she had figured their merits and talents exerted on life 's wide stage .
nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child .
i alighted at perth; and, though much fatigued by a constant exposure to the air for many hours, i would not rest, but merely altering my mode of conveyance, i went by land instead of air, to dunkeld .
safie nursed her with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world .
i looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope, which i dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom .
i traversed the streets without any clear conception of where i was or what i was doing .
i was weary with watching and for some time i had combated with the heavy sleep that weighed down my eyelids: but now, no longer fearful, i threw myself on my bed .
i took a circuitous path, principally for the sake of going to the top of the mount before mentioned, which commanded a view of the city .
when once disease was introduced into the rural districts, its effects appeared more horrible, more exigent, and more difficult to cure, than in towns .
 ''this day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it .
in this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and i myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when i saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life .
no one ventured on board the vessel, and strange sights were averred to be seen at night, walking the deck, and hanging on the masts and shrouds .
i must not forget one incident that occurred during this visit to london .
we have forgotten what we did when she was not .
i collected bones from charnel houses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame .

parliament was divided by three factions, aristocrats, democrats, and royalists .
but if the sentiment on which the fabric of her existence was founded, became common place through participation, the endless succession of attentions and graceful action snapt by transfer, his universe of love wrested from her, happiness must depart, and then be exchanged for its opposite .
their minister at constantinople was urged to make the necessary perquisitions, and should his existence be ascertained, to demand his release .
idris was too much taken up by her own dreadful fears, to be angry, hardly grieved; for she judged that insensibility must be the source of this continued rancour .
their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer .

the countess had failed in this design with regard to her children; perhaps she hoped to find the next remove in birth more tractable .
his intellect found sufficient field for exercise in his domestic circle, whose members, all adorned by refinement and literature, were many of them, like himself, distinguished by genius .
he often left us, and wandered by himself in the woods, or sailed in his little skiff, his books his only companions .
return; dearest one, you promised me this boon, that i should bring you health .
then again she sadly lamented her hard fate; that a woman, with a woman 's heart and sensibility, should be driven by hopeless love and vacant hopes to take up the trade of arms, and suffer beyond the endurance of man privation, labour, and pain the while her dry, hot hand pressed mine, and her brow and lips burned with consuming fire .
she had gone to hide her weakness; escaping from the castle, she had descended to the little park, and sought solitude, that she might there indulge her tears; i found her clinging round an old oak, pressing its rough trunk with her roseate lips, as her tears fell plenteously, and her sobs and broken exclamations could not be suppressed; with surpassing grief i beheld this loved one of my heart thus lost in sorrow i drew her towards me; and, as she felt my kisses on her eyelids, as she felt my arms press her, she revived to the knowledge of what remained to her  .

perdita looked at him like one amazed; her expressive countenance shone for a moment with tenderness; to see him only was happiness .
  ''but when i saw you become the object of another's love; when i imagined that you might be loved otherwise than as a sacred type and image of loveliness and excellence; or that you might love another with a more ardent affection than that which you bore to me, then the fiend awoke within me; i dismissed your lover; and from that moment i have known no peace .
shakspeare, whose popularity was established by the approval of four centuries, had not lost his influence even at this dread period; but was still  ''ut magus, '' the wizard to rule our hearts and govern our imaginations .
in august, the plague had appeared in the country of england, and during september it made its ravages .
he became an adventurer in the greek wars .
 ''wherefore do i feel thus?
 ''my days were spent in close attention, that i might more speedily master the language; and i may boast that i improved more rapidly than the arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken accents, whilst i comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken .
but perfect happiness is an attribute of angels; and those who possess it, appear angelic .
i adverted to what adrian had already done i promised the same vigilance in furthering all his views .
the last beams of the nearly sunken sun shot up from behind the far summit of mount athos; the sea of marmora still glittered beneath its rays, while the asiatic coast beyond was half hid in a haze of low cloud .
as long as their disunion remained a secret, he cherished an expectation of re awakening past tenderness in her bosom; now that we were all made acquainted with these occurrences, and that perdita, by declaring her resolves to others, in a manner pledged herself to their accomplishment, he gave up the idea of re union as futile, and sought only, since he was unable to influence her to change, to reconcile himself to the present state of things .
this idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which i might otherwise have snatched repose and peace .
no youthful congregation of gallant hearted boys thronged the portal of the college; sad silence pervaded the busy school room and noisy playground .
 ''i will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors for so i loved, in an innocent, half painful self deceit, to call them . ''
how mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery i constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land .
i was in the service of a farmer; and with crook in hand, my dog at my side, i shepherded a numerous flock on the near uplands .
her energy of character induced her still to combat with the ills of life; even those attendant on hopeless love presented themselves, rather in the shape of an adversary to be overcome, than of a victor to whom she must submit .
the maniac became composed; his person rose higher; authority beamed from his countenance .
pale as marble, clear and beaming as that, she heard my tale, and enquired concerning the spot where he had been deposited .
when they had retired to rest, if there was any moon or the night was star light, i went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage .
this was all true; but it was not less agonizing to take the admonition home .
cast off the only gift that i have bestowed upon you, your grief, and rise from under my blighting influence as no flower so sweet ever did rise from beneath so much evil .
alas i knew not the desart it was about to reach; the rocks that would tear its waters, and the hideous scene that would be reflected in a more distorted manner in its waves .
my heart beat quick as i approached the palings; my hand was on one of them, a leap would take me to the other side, when two keepers sprang from an ambush upon me: one knocked me down, and proceeded to inflict a severe horse whipping .
my evil passions will have fled, for i shall meet with sympathy my life will flow quietly away, and in my dying moments i shall not curse my maker . ''
 ''elizabeth lavenza  ''geneva, may th,  '' this letter revived in my memory what i had before forgotten, the threat of the fiend  ''i will be with you on your wedding night '' such was my sentence, and on that night would the daemon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings .
he might have spoken, but i did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but i escaped and rushed downstairs .
i turned author myself .
then, in endeavouring to do violence to my own disposition, i made all worse than before .
his graceful elocution enchained the senses of his hearers .
posterity is no more; fame, and ambition, and love, are words void of meaning; even as the cattle that grazes in the field, do thou, o deserted one, lie down at evening tide, unknowing of the past, careless of the future, for from such fond ignorance alone canst thou hope for ease joy paints with its own colours every act and thought .
the theatre was tolerably well filled .
she was nearly fifteen years older than he, and was the offspring of a former marriage of his father .
they stole off at first by ones and twos, then in larger companies, until, unimpeded by the officers, whole battalions sought the road that led to macedonia .
i am glad that i have loved, and have experienced sympathetic joy and sorrow with my fellow creatures .
i went up to her and offered my services .
he admitted that the principles that i laid down were the best; but he denied that they were the only ones .
and when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived . ''
one of these fragile mirrors, that ever doted on thine image, is about to be broken, crumbled to dust .
calderon de la barca .
he was detained three days longer and then he hastened to her .
and why should i describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel?
but i paused when i reflected on the story that i had to tell .
ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the impetuous arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty .
i did not weep, but i wiped the perspiration from my brow, and tried to still my brain and heart beating almost to madness .
but now i went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands .
we hired a chaise here, and with four horses drove with speed through the storm .
thus, we talked of them, and moralized, as with diminished numbers we returned to windsor castle .
through asia, from the banks of the nile to the shores of the caspian, from the hellespont even to the sea of oman, a sudden panic was driven .
idris, the most affectionate wife, sister and friend, was a tender and loving mother .
but, my dear frankenstein, '' continued he, stopping short and gazing full in my face,  ''i did not before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for several nights . ''
she first assured him of her boundless confidence; of this he must be conscious, since but for that she would not seek to detain him .
he had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck .
 ''abhorred monster fiend that thou art the tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes .
no, all must be changed .
agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but i generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father .
still she felt sure that he would come at last; and the wider the breach might appear at this crisis, the more secure she was of closing it for ever .
yet he was never in better health .
i was beyond measure disturbed by this intelligence .
 ''your arrival, my dear cousin, '' said she,  ''fills me with hope .
what, if circumstance should lead perdita to suspect, and suspecting to be resolved?
the wind, prince of air, raged through his kingdom, lashing the sea into fury, and subduing the rebel earth into some sort of obedience .
the season of the assizes approached .
   'by your language, stranger, i suppose you are my countryman; are you french?'  '''no; but i was educated by a french family and understand that language only .
we rapidly drew near, so that at length the number and forms of those within could be discerned; its dark sides grew big, and the splash of its oars became audible: i could distinguish the languid form of my friend, as he half raised himself at our approach .
perdita was still to a great degree uneducated .
i feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion .
after all we miscalculated .
his health was impaired beyond hope of cure; and it became his earnest wish, before he died, to preserve his daughter from the poverty which would be the portion of her orphan state .
young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, m  . clerval: i was myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time. ''
had i never quitted windsor, these emotions would not have been so intense; but i had in greece been the prey of fear and deplorable change; in greece, after a period of anxiety and sorrow, i had seen depart two, whose very names were the symbol of greatness and virtue .
oh not the ten thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution .
 ''and do you dream? '' said the daemon .
i lived in a temple glorified by intensest sense of devotion and rapture; i walked, a consecrated being, contemplating only your power, your excellence; for o, you stood beside me, like my youth, transformed for me the real to a dream, cloathing the palpable and familiar with golden exhalations of the dawn .
many went up as high as belfast to ensure a shorter passage, and then journeying south through scotland, they were joined by the poorer natives of that country, and all poured with one consent into england .
but it was not so; thou didst seek my extinction, that i might not cause greater wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which i feel .
among these, and highly distinguished by her, was prince zaimi, ambassador to england from the free states of greece; and his daughter, the young princess evadne, passed much of her time at windsor castle .
 ''another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings .
at first, i had spoken only to those nearest me; but the whole assembly gathered about me, and i found that i was listened to by all .
shame seemed to hold him back; yet he evidently wished to establish a renewal of confidence and affection .
i obtained from my father a respite of some weeks .
we were in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed .
this may not be; cease to argue the point, for i cannot consent . ''
he was perfectly self possessed; he accosted us both with courtesy, seemed immediately to enter into our feelings, and to make one with us .
for a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers .
six years have passed since i resolved on my present undertaking .
the very boldness of his language gave him weight; each knew that he spoke truth a truth known, but not acknowledged .
we assembled again towards evening, and perdita insisted on our having recourse to music .
you well know that on the whole earth there is no sacrifise that i would not make, no labour that i would not undergo with the mere hope that i might bring you ease .
in the heart of one like me there are secret thoughts working, and secret tortures which you ought not to seek to discover .
supporting her as i did, still she lagged: and at the distance of half a mile, after many stoppages, shivering fits, and half faintings, she slipt from my supporting arm on the snow, and with a torrent of tears averred that she must be taken, for that she could not proceed .
yet how could i find this?
she alone knew the weight which raymond attached to his success .
she quitted her native greece; her father died; by degrees she was cut off from all the companions and ties of her youth .
he died in debt, and his little property was seized immediately by his creditors .
we talked of the ravages made last year by pestilence in every quarter of the world; and of the dreadful consequences of a second visitation .
i observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished .
but i perceive, too soon for my own happiness, too late for england 's good, that i undertook a task to which i am unequal .
he had vowed to be with me on my wedding night, yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats .
if you feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast a gloom over us .
the nations beneath their influence bowed their heads, and died .
he was forever busy, and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind .
they produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection .
by some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided .
i shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling .
if the multitude of mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for my destruction .
with sincerity and fervour he gave the required promise: as a pledge of continued favour, he received from his royal master a sum of money to defray pressing debts, and enable him to enter under good auspices his new career .
i must arise and examine .
alas for human reason he accused the greeks of superstition: what name did he give to the faith he lent to the predictions of evadne?
from her i should learn the truth concerning our protector; i should hear why she had withdrawn from the protection of the princess evadne, and be instructed as to the influence which this overtopping and towering raymond exercised over the fortunes of my friend .
our nature dim, like to an unlighted torch, sleeps in formless blank till the fire attain it; this life of life, this light to moon, and glory to the sun .
i was indignant that he should sit at the same table with the companions of raymond men of abandoned characters, or rather without any, the refuse of high bred luxury, the disgrace of their country .
when i was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm .
before this event, the little beings, sprung from herself, the young heirs of her transient life, seemed to have a sure lease of existence; now she dreaded that the pitiless destroyer might snatch her remaining darlings, as it had snatched their brother .
 ''thus, '' she cried,  ''kindness can do, what no want, no misery ever effected; i weep . ''
 ''now by the fells of cumberland, '' i cried,  ''by all of the vagabond and poacher that appertains to me, i will stand at your side, draw my sword in the greek cause, and be hailed as a victor along with you '' all the plain, from kishan to rodosto, a distance of sixteen leagues, was alive with troops, or with the camp followers, all in motion at the approach of a battle .
who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of mont saleve?
 ''it was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country man as a guide .
it was not however money, except partially, but the necessaries of life, that became scarce .
how can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this exile?
if i succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you and i may meet .
i found several letters, and, among others, one which i discovered from its commencement to be from your father .
this address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor .
i enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future .
i feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet i was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me .
but adrian read with uncertain aim the charactery of her face, and might mistake .
sometimes she observed the war of elements, thinking that they also declared against her, and listened to the pattering of the rain in gloomy despair .
must we prepare our funeral repast with labour, and with unseemly drudgery heap fuel on our deserted hearths must we with servile hands fabricate the garments, soon to be our shroud?
i had vowed to my own heart never to shadow her countenance even with transient grief, and should i prove recreant at the hour of greatest need?
there was a companionship in suffering there, and, the neighbours keeping constant watch on each other, and inspired by the active benevolence of adrian, succour was afforded, and the path of destruction smoothed .
the moment adrian should be legally elected his deputy, he would escape to safety .
i would walk barefoot through the world, to find an uninfected spot; i would build my home on some wave tossed plank, drifted about on the barren, shoreless ocean .
i cannot lead them unwillingly to danger, and i must return . ''
her hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head .
i replied carelessly, and partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors i had studied .
he however attained his wish; he filled the situation for which nature seemed to have moulded him .
they swept the country like a conquering army, burning laying waste murdering .
when a servant came to ask me if i would take food i learnt from him that my father had returned, and was apparently well and this relieved me from a load of anxiety, yet i did not cease to weep bitterly .
the idea once broached, all were impatient to put it in execution .
preserve her for her own sake i know that you will if you require any other spur, think that, in preserving her, you preserve me .
she did not believe that he was dead, but she knew that he was in danger, and the hope of assisting in his liberation, and the idea of soothing by tenderness the ills that he might have undergone, elevated and harmonized the late jarring element of her being .
i was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my resolution .
the confusion grew their looks of sorrow changed to mockery; they nodded their heads in time to the music, whose clang became maddening .
it is not pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power . ''
thus full of contradictions, unbending yet haughty, gentle yet fierce, tender and again neglectful, he by some strange art found easy entrance to the admiration and affection of women; now caressing and now tyrannizing over them according to his mood, but in every change a despot .
her eyes could not be deeper than they were in childhood, nor her countenance more expressive; but the expression was changed and improved; intelligence sat on her brow; when she smiled her face was embellished by the softest sensibility, and her low, modulated voice seemed tuned by love .
the usual expression of his eyes was soft, though at times he could make them even glare with ferocity; his complexion was colourless; and every trait spoke predominate self will; his smile was pleasing, though disdain too often curled his lips lips which to female eyes were the very throne of beauty and love .
never did any woman appear so entirely made of mind, as the countess of windsor .
idris had shared perdita  's ill opinion of the greek; but raymond's account softened and interested her .
frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man .
but these are precious moments; devil as i am become, yet that is my mathilda before me whom i love as one was never before loved: and she knows it now; she listens to these words which i thought, fool as i was, would blast her to death .
yet, when she stood in unassuming simplicity before us, playing with our children, or with girlish assiduity performing little kind offices for idris, one wondered in what fair lineament of her pure loveliness, in what soft tone of her thrilling voice, so much of heroism, sagacity and active goodness resided .
half england was desolate, when october came, and the equinoctial winds swept over the earth, chilling the ardours of the unhealthy season .
the death of many of our inmates had weaned us from the fond idea, that windsor castle was a spot sacred from the plague; but our lease of life was renewed for some months, and even idris lifted her head, as a lily after a storm, when a last sunbeam tinges its silver cup .
obeying these impulses, he had become the husband of perdita: egged on by them, he found himself the lover of evadne .
she loved him as a kind elder brother; a relation to guide, protect, and instruct her, without the too frequent tyranny of parental authority .
yes it was despair i felt; for the first time that phantom seized me; the first and only time for it has never since left me after the first moments of speechless agony i felt her fangs on my heart: i tore my hair; i raved aloud; at one moment in pity for his sufferings i would have clasped my father in my arms; and then starting back with horror i spurned him with my foot; i felt as if stung by a serpent, as if scourged by a whip of scorpions which drove me ah whither whither?
at length i arrived at the village of chamounix .
the country afforded no such mass of horrors; solitary wretches died in the open fields; and i have found a survivor in a vacant village, contending at once with famine and disease; but the assembly of pestilence, the banqueting hall of death, was spread only in london .
he entreated me to write often .
at the end of a month he suddenly quitted his house and, unatteneded sic by any servant, departed from that part of the country without by word or writing informing any one of his intentions .
during my wanderings i never slept without first calling down gentle dreams on your head .
we sat like one family round my hearth .
such were we upon earth, wondering aghast at the effects of pestilence .
the blue and troubled sea sped past the vessel, and was spread shoreless around: the sky was covered by a rack, which in its swift motion shewed how speedily she was borne away .
my dear sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew . ''
there is no more painful sight than that of untimely care in children, and it was particularly observable in one whose disposition had heretofore been mirthful .
a presentiment of ill hung over her .
two soldiers contended for a girl, whose rich dress and extreme beauty excited the brutal appetites of these wretches, who, perhaps good men among their families, were changed by the fury of the moment into incarnated evils .
but i was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and accordingly i told clerval that i wished to make the tour of scotland alone .
be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock .
for the will of man is omnipotent, blunting the arrows of death, soothing the bed of disease, and wiping away the tears of agony .
at that moment i heard the steps of my younger protectors .
chapter day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to geneva; and i could not collect the courage to recommence my work .
she could not disguise to herself that any change would separate her from him; now she saw him each day .
raymond would follow soon, she said; he had been detained by business .
when i reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation .
i awoke from disturbed dreams .
perdita 's mind was not softened by this account .
he approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes .
about this time we retired to our house at belrive .
all was again silent, but his words rang in my ears .
close to the spot on which we stood, was a solitary rock, high and conical, which, divided on every side from the mountain, seemed a nature hewn pyramid; with little labour this block was reduced to a perfect shape; the narrow cell was scooped out beneath in which raymond was placed, and a short inscription, carved in the living stone, recorded the name of its tenant, the cause and aera of his death .
the poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance .
i entered its gloomy walls in a fit of triumphant extasy:  ''he feels me now, '' i cried,  ''and shall, again and again '' i passed but one day in confinement; in the evening i was liberated, as i was told, by the order of the earl himself .
yet a whole life of falsehood was otherwise my portion: and when remorse at being the contriver of any cheat made me shrink from my design i was irresistably led back and confirmed in it by the visit of some aunt or cousin, who would tell me that death was the end of all men .
no office, no devotion, no watching was irksome to her, as it regarded him .
a sister of my father was with him at this period .
it was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before .
this i most earnestly entreat, and i know you will comply . ''
i do not intend to hurt you; listen to me  . '  ''he struggled violently.
their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold .
the unexampled loveliness of the flower clad earth the genial sunshine and grateful shade the melody of the birds the majesty of the woods the splendour of the marble ruins the clear effulgence of the stars by night the combination of all that was exciting and voluptuous in this transcending land, by inspiring a quicker spirit of life and an added sensitiveness to every articulation of her frame, only gave edge to the poignancy of her grief .
this was a new sight to me, and i examined the structure with great curiosity .
ah if you knew what i have suffered and what i may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy . ''
i spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing .
again in vengeance of his wrath he falls on their great hosts, and breaks their tottering walls; arrests their navies on the ocean 's plain, and whelms their strength with mountains of the main .
adrian it is true had already gone to seek the fugitive, imagining that her tameless anxiety had led her to the purlieus of the house, and that some sinister event detained her .
such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day .
and now let the reader, passing over some short period of time, be introduced to our happy circle .
he made her warm offers of service; she was too much occupied by more engrossing thoughts, either to accept or reject them; at length he left her, making a promise to repeat his visit the next day .
the blood of my forefathers cries aloud in my veins, and bids me be first among my countrymen .
the wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me .
it contained but two rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury .

fear overcame me; i dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although i was unable to define them .
the course of the rhine below mainz becomes much more picturesque .
she soon went to pieces; i was shewn where she had been, and saw her disjoined timbers tossed on the waves .
i imagined, that it was my imperative duty to take her from scenes that thus forcibly reminded her of her loss .
mine has been a tale of horrors; i have reached their acme, and what i must now relate can but be tedious to you .
the district which contained them appeared the abode of every kindly spirit .
heavy falls of snow gave an arctic appearance to the scenery; the roofs of the houses peeped from the white mass; the lowly cot and stately mansion, alike deserted, were blocked up, their thresholds uncleared; the windows were broken by the hail, while the prevalence of a north east wind rendered out door exertions extremely painful .
do not turn from me; i do not ask you to reveal it: i only entreat you to listen to me and to become familiar with the voice of consolation and kindness .
adrian 's countenance flitted across, tainted by death idris, with eyes languidly closed and livid lips, was about to slide into the wide grave .
i i alone was the cause of his defeat and justly did i pay the fearful penalty .
i gasped for breath  ''i will not detail to you, '' continued raymond,  ''the melancholy particulars .
i forgot the distance between us:  ''i will go with thee, raymond '' i cried; but, my eye removed from the glass, i could scarce discern the pigmy forms of the crowd, which about a mile from me surrounded the gate; the form of raymond was lost .
i am not yet fallen so low; my honour is not yet so tarnished .
the thought was fleeting; for his attention was instantly drawn towards the inhabitant of this wretched abode .
but there was a fearlessness and frankness about her, which said that she would not encroach on another 's liberty, but held her own sacred and unassailable .
august , yesterday the stranger said to me,  ''you may easily perceive, captain walton, that i have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes .
on a sudden i heard a gentle step ascending the stairs; i paused breathless, and as it approached glided into an obscure corner of the room; the steps paused at my door, but after a few moments they again receeded, descended the stairs and i heard no more .
i entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves .
the merriment of the hour was an unholy mockery of the sorrows of man .
if, on the contrary, they are proof against expostulation, this very steadiness is an omen of success; and it becomes the duty of those who love them, to assist in smoothing the obstructions in their path .
i then paused, and a cold shivering came over me .
the few ineffectual words he had said concerning his duty were to me a further proof and the more i studied the letter the more did i perceive a thousand slight expressions that could only indicate a knowledge that life was now over for him .
in italy the rivers were unwatched by the diminished peasantry; and, like wild beasts from their lair when the hunters and dogs are afar, did tiber, arno, and po, rush upon and destroy the fertility of the plains .
even to us he assumed gaiety and hope, and assumed them so well, that we did not divine the secret workings of his mind .
good god in what desert land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient?
i avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch i had created .
in the autumn of this year , the spirit of emigration crept in among the few survivors, who, congregating from various parts of england, met in london .
she drifted towards the harbour, and was stranded on the sands at the entrance .
her eyes glistened with tears when she thanked me, and the grace of her expressions was enhanced, not diminished, by the fervour, which caused her almost to falter as she spoke .
the revenue of its possessor, which had always found a mode of expenditure congenial to his generous nature, was now attended to more parsimoniously, that it might embrace a wider portion of utility .
the modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles .
nay, henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe .
i listened to this discourse with the extremest agony .
who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee?
unwonted silence reigned in the house, the members spoke in whispers, and the ordinary business was transacted with celerity and quietness .
will you commune less with his departed spirit, while you watch over and cultivate the rare excellence of his child?
perdita listened to me impatiently, and answered with some asperity:  ''do you think that any of your arguments are new to me? or that my own burning wishes and intense anguish have not suggested them all a thousand times, with far more eagerness and subtlety than you can put into them?
the image of clerval was forever before me, ghastly and murdered .
it was a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence .
still perdita would expect him; he wrote a few incoherent words on a scrap of paper, testifying that he was well, and bade the woman of the house take it to the palace, and deliver it into the hands of the wife of the lord protector .
i wept for a long time untill i saw him about to revive, when horror and misery again recurred, and the tide of my sensations rolled back to their former channel: with a terror i could not restrain i sprung up and fled, with winged speed, along the paths of the wood and across the fields untill nearly dead i reached our house and just ordering the servants to seek my father at the spot i indicated, i shut myself up in my own room .
organs of articulate sound did not proclaim the union of our hearts; for untoward circumstance allowed no opportunity for the expression that hovered on our lips .
i had several times seen him ride across the heath and felt angry that my solitude should be disturbed .
woodville was free from all these evils; and if slight examples did come across him he did not notice them but passed on in his course as an angel with winged feet might glide along the earth unimpeded by all those little obstacles over which we of earthly origin stumble .
when i had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, i thought of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay .
we attempted to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted .
on perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in english, although with a foreign accent .
 ''good god he is gone but tell how this was; speak quick '' her relation was short .
 ''have you, then, some other attachment? ''  ''none on earth .
besides, i found that my understanding improved so much with every day 's experience that i was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity .
he often left perdita, to wander in the grounds alone; or in a light shallop he floated idly on the pure waters, musing deeply .
idris must not see him in this state .
the horse then galopped swiftly across the heath and the stranger remained on the ground stunned by his fall .
the change of scene operated to a great degree as i expected; after a year 's absence, perdita returned in gentler and more docile mood to windsor .
here aloft, the companions of the swift winged birds, we skim through the unresisting element, fleetly and fearlessly .
aye, i might die my soul with falsehood untill i had quite hid its native colour .
presently i heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door opened, and the wretch whom i dreaded appeared .
they were formed for one another and they soon loved .
i was not angry on my own account, but i felt as if the praises which this idol received were leaves torn from laurels destined for adrian .
could we domesticate a cub of this wild beast, and not fear its growth and maturity?
are you to be happy while i grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness?
yet when i effected my purpose, all i could discern within the precincts of the massive walls was a city of fire: the open way through which raymond had ridden was enveloped in smoke and flame .
he did not raise his, but after a short silence he replied to me in a low voice:  ''you are indeed presumptuous, mathilda, presumptuous and very rash .
assuredly he had not conned his lesson; and at first he hesitated, pausing in his ideas, and in the choice of his expressions .
in the south, the disease, virulent and immedicable, had nearly annihilated the race of man; storm and inundation, poisonous winds and blights, filled up the measure of suffering .
at the battle of makri he had led the charge of cavalry, and pursued the fugitives even to the banks of the hebrus .
but it was not so, i was yet young, oh far too young, nor was he dead to others; but i, most miserable, must never see or speak to him again .
i had wandered towards bracknel, far to the west of windsor .
he said this in his most gay, yet benevolent manner, and smiled, not disdainfully, but in playful mockery of himself .
he had introduced himself to adrian, by a request he made to observe some planetary motions from his glass .
i had visited it frequently during my boyhood .
saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in my sentiments .
there was so much intelligence combined with innocence, sensibility with forbearance, and seriousness with perfect good humour, a beauty so transcendant, united to such endearing simplicity, that she hung like a pearl in the shrine of our possessions, a treasure of wonder and excellence .
england, late birth place of excellence and school of the wise, thy children are gone, thy glory faded thou, england, wert the triumph of man small favour was shewn thee by thy creator, thou isle of the north; a ragged canvas naturally, painted by man with alien colours; but the hues he gave are faded, never more to be renewed .
one only return did he owe me, even fidelity .
still his mother did not despair .
this was not universal .
the spirit of superstition had birth, from the wreck of our hopes, and antics wild and dangerous were played on the great theatre, while the remaining particle of futurity dwindled into a point in the eyes of the prognosticators .
i must not be trifled with, and i demand an answer .
in our happiest days, perdita had adorned her cottage with every aid art might bring, to that which nature had selected to favour .
 ''justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and i recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one glance from justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that ariosto gives concerning the beauty of angelica she looked so frank hearted and happy .
we still had some attendants spared by disease, and warmly attached to us .
i saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilized man .
the forest glades, the ferny dells, and lawny uplands, the cultivated and cheerful country spread around the silver pathway of ancient thames, all earth, air, and wave, took up one choral voice, inspired by memory, instinct with plaintive regret .
but now, as soon as the horses arrived, i hurried into a cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend .
but this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which i had been progressively led to it were obliterated, and i beheld only the result .
the moon i gazed with a kind of wonder .
on the th of december of that year, my companion and i crossed the bay, to visit the antiquities which are scattered on the shores of baiae .
the natural clinging of the human mind to life and joy was in its full energy in her young heart; she gave herself impetuously up to the enchantment: they were married; and in their radiant features i saw incarnate, for the last time, the spirit of love, of rapturous sympathy, which once had been the life of the world .
evadne was two years older than adrian; and who, at eighteen, ever loved one so much their junior?
poor girl she wept when she quitted our house; she was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity .
they went to the river to break the ice, and draw water: they assembled on foraging expeditions, or axe in hand felled the trees for fuel .
all i can say is, that it is so .
among a race of independent, and generous, and well educated men, in a country where the imagination is empress of men 's minds, there needs be no fear that we should want a perpetual succession of the high born and lordly .
i renounced it to gain no matter what for that also i have lost .
the words of his letter by which he had dissuaded me from this step were those that determined me .
 ''william is dead that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay victor, he is murdered  ''i will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction .
the gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, i felt depressed; when they rejoiced, i sympathized in their joys .
 ''we cannot hope to live so long in our names as some have done in their persons; one face of janus holds no proportion to the other . ''
were not the mightiest men of the olden times kings?
perhaps there was besides a lurking dislike to bind herself in the face of the world to one whom she did not love not love, at least, with that passionate enthusiasm which her heart told her she might one day feel towards another .
sometimes, indeed, i dreamt that i wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth, but i awoke and found myself in a dungeon .
i smiled incredulously, and replied:   ''i am of ryland's way of thinking, and will, if you please, repeat all his arguments; we shall see how far you will be induced by them, to change the royal for the patriotic style . ''
even if they were to leave europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the daemon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror .
i saw him too; he was free last night ''  ''i do not know what you mean, '' replied my brother, in accents of wonder,  ''but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery .
frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the cause of the tumult .
i formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of me .
one thing you must promise, not to speak to any one but your uncle, of the conversation you have just overheard .
he had carried off their store of winter food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of the horror struck villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal frosts .
i administered the fitting remedies, and left my sweet niece to watch beside him, and bring me notice of any change she should observe .
if she were to continue inflexible in the line of conduct she now pursued, they must part .
how strange, i thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects i examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood .
for my hope who shall see it?
there can be no community between you and me; we are enemies .
i was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate .
she encouraged his craving for knowledge and his impetuous courage; she even tolerated his tameless love of freedom, under the hope that this would, as is too often the case, lead to a passion for command .
at first the increase of sickness in spring brought increase of toil to such of us, who, as yet spared to life, bestowed our time and thoughts on our fellow creatures .
meanwhile her active fancy wove a thousand combinations; she dreamt  ''of moving accidents by flood and field '' she lost herself delightedly in these self created wanderings, and returned with unwilling spirit to the dull detail of common life .
shutting the door, he approached me and said in a smothered voice,  ''you have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you intend?
he sent even to italy and greece for drawings; but, as the design was to be characterized by originality as well as by perfect beauty, his endeavours were for a time without avail .
shall i meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of africa or america?
the air resounded with their shouts; their picturesque costume, and the gay colours of which it was composed, flaunted in the sunshine; their eager gestures and rapid utterance accorded with their wild appearance .
at this period the name and exploits of one of my countrymen filled the world with admiration .
guided by a slight clue, i followed the windings of the rhone, but vainly .
there was so much of truth and nature in his resentment, that her doubts were dispelled .
alas he is cold, he cannot answer me . ''
what can i say? if you refuse to aid me, i am lost indeed '' she cast up her eyes, while wonder held her auditors mute; then, as if carried away by her feelings, she cried  ''my brother beloved, ill fated adrian how speak of your misfortunes?
however, it was hardly morning, and i might reasonably hope to arrive by night .
it seems as if the giant waves of ocean, and vast arms of the sea, were about to wrench the deep rooted island from its centre; and cast it, a ruin and a wreck, upon the fields of the atlantic .
the disposition of idris was peculiarly frank, soft, and affectionate .
i remained for several years their only child .
after the lapse of more than a year, adrian returned from greece .
thus perhaps as the sensation of immediate suffering wore off, i became more human .
it was a curious fact, that at this period, when by the marriage of perdita i was allied to one of the richest individuals in england, and was bound by the most intimate friendship to its chiefest noble, i experienced the greatest excess of poverty that i had ever known .
he was all gaiety; scraps of songs fell from his lips; every thought of his mind every object about us, gleamed under the sunshine of his mirth .
the body of the man who had landed, had been buried deep in the sands; and none could tell more, than that the vessel was american built, and that several months before the fortunatas had sailed from philadelphia, of which no tidings were afterwards received .
each long hour was counted, and  ''he suffers '' was the burthen of all her thoughts .
i would not disturb you at this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a conversation that i had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet .
my father was one of those men on whom nature had bestowed to prodigality the envied gifts of wit and imagination, and then left his bark of life to be impelled by these winds, without adding reason as the rudder, or judgment as the pilot for the voyage .
not so with us, the remnant .
 ''justine moritz poor, poor girl, is she the accused?
many of our visitors left us: those whose homes were far in the south, fled delightedly from our northern winter, and sought their native land, secure of plenty even after their fearful visitation .
the last words of evadne were the seal upon the warrant of my death .
immense glaciers approached the road; i heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage .
fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which i had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of paradise lost, a volume of plutarch 's lives, and the sorrows of werter .
in a moment however she revived, and, with energy, almost with violence, entreated me to saddle horses, to take her away, away to london to her brother at least to save her .
the wind, favourable to him, blew so strongly in shore, that we were unable, as we had at first intended, to meet him on his watery road .
the thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness .
the pain inflicted by this disappointment was tormenting and keen .
 ''you are in the wrong, '' replied the fiend;  ''and instead of threatening, i am content to reason with you .
 ''she was '', he said,  ''the brightest vision that ever came upon the earth: there was somthing in her frank countenance, in her voice, and in every motion of her graceful form that overpowered me, as if it were a celestial creature that deigned to mingle with me in intercourse more sweet than man had ever before enjoyed .
i afterwards learned that, knowing my father 's advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder .
farewell, my dear, excellent margaret .
my aunt was only relieved of her anxiety concerning his fate by a letter from him dated hamburgh .
oh, this was a delicious life quite void of guile i with my dove  's look and fox's heart: for indeed i felt only the degradation of falsehood, and not any sacred sentiment of conscious innocence that might redeem it .
it was part of the ex queen 's plan, to surround her son with princely magnificence .
 ''my dear father, you are mistaken; justine is innocent . ''
for myself, there was one reward i promised myself from my detested toils one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, i might claim elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her .
with the declining heat of a september night, a whirlwind of storm, thunder, and hail, rattled round the house, and with ghastly harmony sung the dirge of her family .
he heartily despised himself, he was angry with perdita, and the idea of evadne was attended by all that was hideous and cruel .
i looked back to my restless desires and painful struggles with my fellow beings as to a troubled dream, and felt myself as much changed as if i had transmigrated into another form, whose fresh sensorium and mechanism of nerves had altered the reflection of the apparent universe in the mirror of mind .
take me mould me to your will, possess my heart and soul to all eternity .
she neglected even her child; shutting her heart against all tenderness, she grew reserved towards me, her first and fast friend .
for a moment i could yield to the creative power of the imagination, and for a moment was soothed by the sublime fictions it presented to me .
i would not yield, but to the last gasp resolutely defended my dear ones against sorrow and pain; and if i were vanquished at last, it should not be ingloriously .
her intrigues with russia for the furtherance of her object, excited the jealousy of the porte, and the animosity of the greek government .
it was madness i believe, but i so worked myself up to this idea that i could think of nothing else .
urged by this view, i refused, and i did right in refusing, to create a companion for the first creature .
the air is empoisoned, and each human being inhales death, even while in youth and health, their hopes are in the flower .
wretched devil you reproach me with your creation, come on, then, that i may extinguish the spark which i so negligently bestowed . ''
she was for a while the sole object of his reveries; and perdita became aware that his thoughts and time were bestowed on a subject unparticipated by her .
the physical state of man would soon not yield to the beatitude of angels; disease was to be banished; labour lightened of its heaviest burden .
my own heart was racked by regrets and remorse .
a short conversation passed between us, but the next day he again stopped at my cottage and by degrees an intimacy grew between us .
 ''yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions .
for the first time in my life i envied the sleep of the dead, and thought with pleasure of one 's bed under the sod, where grief and fear have no power .
i was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth .
so that when we make our hearts a lair for that gently seeming beast, its companion enters with it, and pitilessly lays waste what might have been an home and a shelter . ''
now i was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel houses .
this idea was torture to him .
if you will comply with my conditions, i will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, i will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends . ''
our numbers were to move forward in separate parties, and to go by different routes, all to unite at last at paris .
raymond, the deliverer of greece, the graceful soldier, who bore in his mien a tinge of all that, peculiar to her native clime, evadne cherished as most dear raymond was loved by evadne .
and now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life .
if my last combat is now about to be fought, and i am to be worsted so let it be ''  ''but come, ryland, recollect yourself men have hitherto thought you magnanimous and wise, will you cast aside these titles?
i was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of jura .
they shall go down together to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust yes my hope was corruption and dust and all to which death brings us .
thou and nature are still true to me .
at length the rooms began to thin .
at length we arrived at a large, desert, dark cavern, which the lazzeroni assured us was the sibyl 's cave .
readiness of talent, a capacity of entering into, and leading the dispositions of men; earnest desire of distinction were the awakeners and nurses of his ambition .
expectation, and hopes, and affection were all too much for me .
with such schooling did my poor idris try to hush thronging fears, and in some measure succeeded .
i do not address them to you alone because it will give me pleasure to dwell upon our friendship in a way that would be needless if you alone read what i shall write .
live stock diminished sensibly in the country, from the effects of the great demand in the market .
at length i gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion .
the moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise .
how in poor assemblage of words convey the halo of glory that surrounded her, the thousand graces that waited unwearied on her .
you may easily imagine that i was much gratified by the offered communication, yet i could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes .
she started wildly from her couch, and flew to the cabin window .
i believe it was that coming out with a determination not to be repulsed i went right forward to my object without well weighing his replies: i was led by passion and drew him with frantic heedlessness into the abyss that he so fearfully avoided i replied to his terrific words:  ''you fill me with affright it is true, dearest father, but you only confirm my resolution to put an end to this state of doubt .
i grew impatient, i wept; sic and wrung my hands but still i could not discover my path .
she had read no novels and associated only with her younger sisters, what could she know of the difference between love and friendship?
there is no fruition in their vacant kindness, and sharp rocks lurk beneath the smiling ripples of these shallow waters .
he played a sweet mournful air which i perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet .
we were about to return homewards, when a voice, a human voice, strange now to hear, attracted our attention .
a few men came to aid him; their numbers increased; under their united blows the obstacle was vanquished, gate, portcullis, and fence were demolished; and the wide sun lit way, leading to the heart of the city, now lay open before them .
as the rules of order and pressure of laws were lost, some began with hesitation and wonder to transgress the accustomed uses of society .
we passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw mont saleve, the pleasant banks of montalegre, and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful mont blanc and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it .
my dream recurred to my thoughts; i was not usually superstitious but in wretchedness every one is so .
the aspect of the country had so far changed, that it had been impossible to enter on the task of sowing seed, and other autumnal labours .
then came the tale of hair breadth escapes, combats with dogs, ambush and flight, as gipsey like we encompassed our pot .
i cannot live the object of suspicion you cannot believe me let us part ''  ''exactly so, '' cried perdita,  ''i knew that it would come to this are we not already parted?
he wished to repay the kindness of the athenians, to keep alive the splendid associations connected with his name, and to eradicate from europe a power which, while every other nation advanced in civilization, stood still, a monument of antique barbarism .
you may see him his hair stuck with wild flowers his eyes full of untraceable meaning his voice broken his person wasted to a shadow .
during the first months of his protectorate, raymond and she had been inseparable; each project was discussed with her, each plan approved by her .
he asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy .
 ''come, '' said raymond,  ''i yielded to you yesterday, now comply with my request take the pencil . ''
her guardian was not displeased with their mutual affection: the merit of woodville was too eminent to admit of cavil on account of his inferior wealth; but the dying will of her father did not allow her to marry before she was of age and her fortune depended upon her obeying this injunction .
the very danger drew them closer .
the myrtle bushes, the thyme, the little cyclamen, which peep from the fissures of the rock, all the produce of the place, bear affinity to him; the light that invests the hills participates in his essence, and sky and mountains, sea and valley, are imbued by the presence of his spirit .
 ''she most of all, '' said ernest,  ''requires consolation; she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched .
he was not at the palace; and, though the attendants did not know whither he had gone, they did not expect him till late at night .
ever after this, i thought, i would live in the most dreary seclusion .
besides, is it not a shame, that the genius of adrian should fade from the earth like a flower in an untrod mountain path, fruitless?
 ''i do know you better, '' i replied  ''than to think that you would be happy in such a situation; but the good you would do to others may be an inducement, since the time is probably arrived when you can put your theories into practice, and you may bring about such reformation and change, as will conduce to that perfect system of government which you delight to portray . ''
i will live and die here  ''go you to england, lionel; return to sweet idris and dearest adrian; return, and let my orphan girl be as a child of your own in your house .
when his children had departed, he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more sweet and mournful than i had ever heard him play before .
many saw, seated above his vice regal throne, a supreme providence, who directed his shafts, and guided his progress, and they bowed their heads in resignation, or at least in obedience .
my cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had become emaciated with confinement .
the appearance of the plain was changed during this short interval; the encampment was broken up; the relics of the disbanded army met in small companies here and there; each face was clouded; every gesture spoke astonishment and dismay .
here i hold communion only with the has been, and to come .
justine, whom i loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?
he spoke with a broken voice, then bowed his head, and, hiding his face in his hands, wept .
he recognised the hand writing of evadne, and the colour mounted in his cheeks .
i was already well acquainted with what i may term the panorama of nature, the change of seasons, and the various appearances of heaven and earth .
how ill you are what is the cause of all this? ''  ''do not ask me, '' cried i, putting my hands before my eyes, for i thought i saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room;  ''he can tell .
but the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and on my return i met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart .
alas i am a most unhappy creature '' i was breathless with emotion, and i paused fixing my earnest eyes on my father, after i had dashed away the intrusive tears that dimmed them .
she was lovely; her manners were frank and simple; her deep blue eyes swam in a lustre which could only be given by sensibility joined to wisdom .
she herself wept as elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer .
in the mean time, while i thus pampered myself with rich mental repasts, a peasant would have disdained my scanty fare, which i sometimes robbed from the squirrels of the forest .
we visited the north of england, my native ulswater, and lingered in scenes dear from a thousand associations .
it was necessary that i should return without delay to geneva, there to watch over the lives of those i so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to blast me by his presence, i might, with unfailing aim, put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which i had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous .
  ''you have learnt a pretty lesson, perdita, '' said i,  ''and repeat it so literally, that you forget the while the proofs we have of the earl's virtues; his generosity to us is manifest in our plenty, his bravery in the protection he affords us, his affability in the notice he takes of us .
i slept too undisturbed by dreams; and awoke refreshed to again enjoy my tranquil freedom .
m   . krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of m. waldman.
by day and night these thoughts pursued me .
i dared hardly consider you as my daughter; your beauty, artlessness and untaught wisdom seemed to belong to a higher order of beings; your voice breathed forth only words of love: if there was aught of earthly in you it was only what you derived from the beauty of the world; you seemed to have gained a grace from the mountain breezes the waterfalls and the lake; and this was all of earthly except your affections that you had; there was no dross, no bad feeling in the composition .
i felt as the sailor, who from the topmast first discovered the shore of america; and like him i hastened to tell my companions of my discoveries in unknown regions .
raymond felt no relief, received no pleasure from any show of heaven or earth .
this was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and i replied earnestly,  ''you are all mistaken; i know the murderer .
she was not her child, but the daughter of a milanese nobleman .
be you witnesses, '' and he took the star, insignia of office, from his breast, and threw it on the table .
yet, when i am dead, if he should appear, if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he shall not live swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes .
i left her, and soon heard that she slept soundly under the influence of the opiate i had administered .
for my own part, since adrian had first withdrawn me from my selvatic wilderness to his own paradise of order and beauty, i had been wedded to literature .
at the same time that he taught me by their means to subdue my own reckless and uncultured spirit, he opened to my view the living page of his own heart, and gave me to feel and understand its wondrous character .
i was led to london, and had to endure for some weeks cold looks, cold words and colder consolations: but i escaped; they tried to bind me with fetters that they thought silken, yet which weighed on me like iron, although i broke them more easily than a girth formed of a single straw and fled to freedom .
i wandered on, and the coming darkness made every trace indistinct by which i might be guided .
the mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved felix were not for me .
this account may be taken as a sample of my intercourse with lord raymond .
he dismissed his servants there, only telling them that he had a sudden call of business and that they were to obey me as their mistress untill his return .
my father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness .
and now, dear margaret, do i not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?
the appetite for admiration and small capacity for self controul which i inherited from my father, nursed by adversity, made me daring and reckless .
the interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion .
 ''they shout, '' i said,  ''because they will soon return to england  . ''  ''do you, then, really return? ''  ''alas yes; i cannot withstand their demands.
he would rather have died such a death, which will be recorded in history to endless time, than have lived to old age unknown, unhonoured .
there is my hope and my expectation; your 's are in this world; may they be fulfilled .
shame shame if the first magistrate of england be foremost to renounce his duties . ''
this was all accomplished even as i wished .
among his other advantages, lord raymond was supremely handsome; every one admired him; of women he was the idol .
the meal was quickly dispatched .
i began to study more; to sympathize more in the thoughts of others as expressed in books; to read history, and to lose my individuallity among the crowd that had existed before me .
methought i had been invited to timon  's last feast; i came with keen appetite, the covers were removed, the hot water sent up its unsatisfying steams, while i fled before the anger of the host, who assumed the form of raymond; while to my diseased fancy, the vessels hurled by him after me, were surcharged with fetid vapour, and my friend's shape, altered by a thousand distortions, expanded into a gigantic phantom, bearing on its brow the sign of pestilence .
from your lips first have i heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; i shall be forever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom i am on the point of meeting  .   '  '''may i know the names and residence of those friends?'  ''i paused.
in greece i had learnt to love him; his very waywardness, and self abandonment to the impulses of superstition, attached me to him doubly; it might be weakness, but it was the antipodes of all that was grovelling and selfish .
o blessed sleep often, when most miserable, i sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture .
immediately before me was the top kapou, the gate near which mahomet had made the breach by which he entered the city .
we had remained five months in london three of joy and two of sorrow .
she looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal .
this may seem madness to you, yet you also have pride and resolution; do not then wonder that my pride is tameless, my resolution unalterable . ''
this passion is detrimental to me, for you do not reflect that you are the cause of its excess .
the very heart and soul of raymond and perdita had mingled, even as two mountain brooks that join in their descent, and murmuring and sparkling flow over shining pebbles, beside starry flowers; but let one desert its primal course, or be dammed up by choaking obstruction, and the other shrinks in its altered banks .
each day, before dawn, we left our night  's encampment, and watched the shadows as they retreated from hill and valley, and the golden splendour of the sun's approach .
subscriptions were made for the emigrants, and merchants bankrupt by the failure of trade .
she had not even the same advantage as i in the recollection of her parents; she clung to me, her brother, as her only friend, but her alliance with me completed the distaste that her protectors felt for her; and every error was magnified by them into crimes .
for some time, the spirit of hilarity was kept up; but, at length, perdita receded from the piano, for raymond had joined in the trio of  ''taci ingiusto core, '' in don giovanni, whose arch entreaty was softened by him into tenderness, and thrilled her heart with memories of the changed past; it was the same voice, the same tone, the self same sounds and words, which often before she had received, as the homage of love to her no longer was it that; and this concord of sound with its dissonance of expression penetrated her with regret and despair .
i lay upon the grass surrounded by a darkness which not the slightest beam of light penetrated there was no sound for the deep night had laid to sleep the insects, the only creatures that lived on the lone spot where no tree or shrub could afford shelter to aught else there was a wondrous silence in the air that calmed my senses yet which enlivened my soul, my mind hurried from image to image and seemed to grasp an eternity .
the guides bring with them materials for renewing the light, but we had none our only resource was to return as we came .
even so was it with the army of greece .
on the eve of the third day i retired early to my room; i could not sleep but paced all night about my chamber and, as you may in scotland at midsummer, watched the crimson track of the sun as it almost skirted the northern horizon .
i was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh .
day after day passed while we discussed our projects for the evening, and each night was occupied by debates which offered no conclusion .
the effect of this scene of incantation communicated a portion of its power to that which followed .
 ''do not answer; i know all your objections, and will reply to them in order .
i do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule .
if i survive, and she be lost, i were far better dead .
if she died, where could there be found on record a murderer, whose cruel act might compare with his?
in reply, my sister requested me to accompany her the following evening to the tomb of raymond .
he had neither the ennobling self gratulation, which constancy inspires, to console him, nor the voluptuous sense of abandonment to a forbidden, but intoxicating passion .
idris endeavoured to persuade her to remain .
what had she done the while, how supported his absence and neglect?
i had gazed with wonder, mixed with fear and enthusiasm .
without the aid of servants, it was necessary to discharge all household duties; hands unused to such labour must knead the bread, or in the absence of flour, the statesmen or perfumed courtier must undertake the butcher 's office .
adrian perceived the change, and feared that it would be difficult to prevent them from wreaking their utmost fury on the irish .
let us lament over and assist the children of the garden of the earth .
their only inhabitant, a little girl, was dancing, waltzing, and singing about them, followed by a large newfoundland dog, who boisterously jumping on her, and interrupting her, made her now scold, now laugh, now throw herself on the carpet to play with him .
after an interval i arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay .
thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin .
at first he did not take his eyes from the papers; when he raised them, he was struck by the wretchedness manifest on her altered cheek; for a moment he forgot his own acts and fears, and asked with consternation  ''dearest girl, what is the matter; what has happened? ''
we cut branches of the funereal trees and placed them over him, and on these again his sword .
i felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death .
by great application, however, and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, i discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; i learned and applied the words,         'fire,' 'milk,' 'bread,' and 'wood .'
she was very earnest to see the corpse .
the monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of anger .
to this state there was no hope, no alleviation, unless the grave should quickly receive its destined prey, and she be permitted to die, before she experienced a thousand living deaths in the loss of those she loved .
she returned to the house about eight o 'clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him .
i knew that i ought to hasten my descent towards the valley, as i should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my heart was heavy, and my steps slow .
i dreaded to behold this monster, but i feared still more that henry should see him .
meanwhile among our guests in the park, all thoughts of festivity had faded .
this aroused the stranger 's attention, and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the demon, as he called him, had pursued .
but to me the remembrance of the threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood, i should almost regard him as invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words  ''i shall be with you on your wedding night, '' i should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable .
but my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and i appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment .
a grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife .
or so my fond fancy imaged some accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my slavery forever .
their extreme youth, and the purity of their attachment, made them yield with less resistance to the tyranny of circumstances .
poor fellow he lay stretched on a bed of sickness, his cheeks glowing with the hues of fever, his eyes half closed, his breath irregular and difficult .
and this medley of undamaged buildings, and luxurious accommodation, in trim and fresh youth, was contrasted with the lonely silence of the unpeopled streets .
by the grandeur of his conceptions, the graceful daring of his actions, by his wit and beauty, he won and ruled the minds of all .
he scarcely appeared half his usual height; his joints were unknit, his limbs would not support him; his face was contracted, his eye wandering; debility of purpose and dastard fear were expressed in every gesture .
his judgment, activity, and consummate bravery, justified their choice .
i lived with a farmer whose house was built higher up among the hills: a dark crag rose behind it, and, exposed to the north, the snow lay in its crevices the summer through .
vanity first prompted me to ask you: vanity, i call it; yet even in this i see the hand of fate your presence will soon be necessary; you will become the last resource of perdita, her protector and consoler .
raymond, the ambitious, restless raymond, reposed midway on the great high road of life, and was content to give up all his schemes of sovereignty and fame, to make one of us, the flowers of the field .
he replied in a hollow voice,  ''why deceive a helpless old man, why talk hypocritically to one half crazed?
  '''heaven forbid even if you were really criminal, for that can only drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue .
if you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity, frankenstein would yet have lived . ''

thus, while perdita was entertaining her guests, and anxiously awaiting the arrival of her lord, his ring was brought her; and she was told that a poor woman had a note to deliver to her from its wearer .
at times like these, minute circumstances assume giant and majestic proportions; the very swinging open of the white gate that admitted us into the forest, arrested my thoughts as matter of interest; it was an every day act, never to occur again the setting crescent of the moon glittered through the massy trees to our right, and when we entered the park, we scared a troop of deer, that fled bounding away in the forest shades .
sometimes she reproached herself for taking too bitterly to heart, that which many would esteem an imaginary evil; but this was no subject for reason; and, ignorant as she was of the motives and true conduct of raymond, things assumed for her even a worse appearance, than the reality warranted .
this professor was very unlike his colleague .
several weeks had elapsed since the festival of the anniversary, and she had been unable to calm her mind, or to subdue her thoughts to any regular train .
he tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of roncesvalles, of the round table of king arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels .
i asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a little food or rest: i required kindness and sympathy; but i did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it .
 ''it seems that the total destruction of constantinople, and the supposition that winter had purified the air of the fallen city, gave the greeks courage to visit its site, and begin to rebuild it .

raymond had quitted the palace the night before; he had promised to grace the assembly, but he had not yet returned .
upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board .

 ''felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court .
the empire of the mahometans in europe was at its close .
she never caressed me, and seemed all the time i staid in the room to fear that i should annoy her by some childish freak .
a silence prevailed, till one of the members coming to me, whispered that the earl of windsor had sent him word that i was to move his election, in the absence of the person who had been first chosen for this office .
i have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey, yet how often have i regretted not being able to perform it myself i figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin .
i built my hope on your confidence .
at noon we met again, and we threw away in contempt our peasant fare, as we built our fire place and kindled the cheering blaze destined to cook the game stolen from the neighbouring preserves .
her letter to raymond gave no clue for discovery; it assured him, that she was in no danger of wanting the means of life; she promised in it to preserve herself, and some future day perhaps to present herself to him in a station not unworthy of her .
he was all animation; you could no longer trace in his look of health, the suffering valetudinarian; from his smile and sprightly tones you could not guess that he was about to lead forth from their native country, the numbered remnant of the english nation, into the tenantless realms of the south, there to die, one by one, till the last man should remain in a voiceless, empty world .

the overgrown metropolis, the great heart of mighty britain, was pulseless .
suffering and amiability may exist together, and writers have loved to depict their conjunction; there is a human and touching harmony in the picture .
on hearing this information i suffered a temporary access of despair .
we passed through busy towns and cultivated plains .
pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of henry, but they soothe my heart, overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates .
 ''is this your promised zeal? ''  ''pardon me, '' i said,  ''but even as you speak, i am gone . ''
i lost sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail, which was now partly filled with milk .
no time or space can tear from my soul that which makes a part of it .
she was half mad from the effects of uncontrollable agitation .
most men ruthlessly destroy the sacred veil, with which the female heart is wont to adorn the idol of its affections .
as i marked the placid expression that had settled on her countenance in death, i felt, in spite of the pangs of remorse, in spite of heart rending regret, that it was better to die so, than to drag on long, miserable years of repining and inconsolable grief .
i alluded to the coldness of her letters; but the few minutes we had spent together sufficiently explained the origin of this .
one secret which i alone possessed was the hope to which i had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, i pursued nature to her hiding places .
i was for ever with him .
a length i found that he had altered his route; at first he had followed the london road; but now he changed it, and upon enquiry i found that the one which he now pursued led towards the sea .
i was their plaything and their idol, and something better their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me .
but even if i were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes, i would not change places with such a wretch . ''
i passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless .
yet one moment, one brief interval before i put from shore once, once again let me fancy myself as i was in in my abode at windsor, let me close my eyes, and imagine that the immeasurable boughs of its oaks still shadow me, its castle walls anear .
i hastened to carry the intelligence of these strange proceedings to perdita; and we were soon joined by raymond .

for the last time we looked on the wide extent of country visible from the terrace, and saw the last rays of the sun tinge the dark masses of wood variegated by autumnal tints; the uncultivated fields and smokeless cottages lay in shadow below; the thames wound through the wide plain, and the venerable pile of eton college, stood in dark relief, a prominent object; the cawing of the myriad rooks which inhabited the trees of the little park, as in column or thick wedge they speeded to their nests, disturbed the silence of evening .
when night came on, she begged that clara might sleep in a separate cabin .

and since in the wide world thou remainest, why should i complain?
i entered, and one glance assured me that its former inhabitant was no more he lay on a heap of straw, cold and stiff; while a pernicious effluvia filled the room, and various stains and marks served to shew the virulence of the disorder .

the multitude extolled the same poems that formed the wonder of the sage in his closet: there was not one dissentient voice .

i crept along by the fern, on my hands and knees, seeking the shadowy coverts of the underwood, while the birds awoke with unwelcome song above, and the fresh morning wind, playing among the boughs, made me suspect a footfall at each turn .
left to myself, i strove with painful intensity to divine the motive of his request and foresee the events of the coming day .
upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder,  ''my dearest victor, what infatuation is this?

 ''how is this? '' he cried .
our little island was filled even to bursting .
alas that in human nature such a pitch of mental discipline, and disdainful negligence of nature itself, should not have been allied to the extreme of moral excellence but the resolution that permitted her to resist the pains of privation, sprung from the too great energy of her passions; and the concentrated self will of which this was a sign, was destined to destroy even the very idol, to preserve whose respect she submitted to this detail of wretchedness .

i considered the being whom i had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me .
he could not really care for me, i thought, for if he did the storm would rather have made him come even if i had not expected him, than, as it did, prevent a promised visit .

woodville had told me that there was in my countenance an expression as if i belonged to another world; so he had seen that sign: and there it lay a gloomy mark to tell the world that there was that within my soul that no silence could render sufficiently obscure .
he sat by her, he took her hand, and said a thousand things which breathed the deepest spirit of compassion and affection .
yet we advanced slowly: sometimes i thought that we should never arrive; that the sound of waves would still allure us, and that we should walk on for ever and ever: field succeeding field, never would our weary journey cease, nor night nor day; but still we should hear the dashing of the sea, and to all this there would be no end .
it was not will that she wanted, but the capacity; again and again she declared, it were as easy to enchain the sea, to put reins on the wind 's viewless courses, as for her to take truth for falsehood, deceit for honesty, heartless communion for sincere, confiding love .
they did not appear rich, but they were contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while mine became every day more tumultuous .
during my absence i should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my departure .
i felt as if i were placed under a ban as if i had no right to claim their sympathies as if never more might i enjoy companionship with them .
does he not on the contrary feel a freedom of will within him, which, though you may call it fallacious, still actuates him as he decides? ''
they had not been long married, and their eldest child was but just born .
gradually the object of fear sank beneath the horizon, and to the last shot up shadowy beams into the otherwise radiant air .
nay, these are virtuous and immaculate beings i, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on .
i indeed perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days ' journey, i beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within me .
we perpetually made excursions together .
entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs, i darted up towards my own room .
i raised his rigid limbs, i marked the distortion of his face, and the stony eyes lost to perception .
my beloved friends were alarmed nay, they expressed their alarm so anxiously, that i dared not pronounce the word plague, that hovered on my lips, lest they should construe my perturbed looks into a symptom, and see infection in my languor .
but i was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey .
as i waited there in expectation of that moment, i thought how, of the lovely flowers that grew there, i would wind myself a chaplet and crown myself for joy: i would sing sul margine d  'un rio, my father's favourite song, and that my voice gliding through the windless air would announce to him in whatever bower he sat expecting the moment of our union, that his daughter was come .
 ''i can hardly describe to you the effect of these books .
it was not for the rose of persia thou wert famous, nor the banana of the east; not for the spicy gales of india, nor the sugar groves of america; not for thy vines nor thy double harvests, nor for thy vernal airs, nor solstitial sun but for thy children, their unwearied industry and lofty aspiration .
i leaned against the casement, and watched those two glorious creatures, till they disappeared in the forest glades; and then i turned .

he was endeavouring to encourage his sister, and to bring her to look on his intent in a less tragic light than she was prepared to do; and with passionate eloquence he unfolded his designs to her  .  ''let me, at the first word, '' he said,  ''relieve your mind from all fear on my account.
i was hurt by the careless tone with which he conveyed this information, and replied coldly:  ''i am obliged to you for your intelligence, and will avail myself of it . ''
look at his thought endued countenance, his graceful limbs, his majestic brow, his wondrous mechanism the type and model of this best work of god is not to be cast aside as a broken vessel he shall be preserved, and his children and his children 's children carry down the name and form of man to latest time .
distinction and station were not the qualifications of their election .
such for three days and nights appeared the consummation which fate had decreed for my labours, and i became haggard and spectre like, through anxiety and watching .
my dream was for ever in my thoughts, and with a kind of half insanity that often possesses the mind in despair, i said aloud;  ''courage we are not near the sea; we are yet several miles from the ocean '' yet it was towards the sea that our direction lay and that heightened the confusion of my ideas .
i have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed . ''
presently i saw the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard .

in pursuance of this idea, he pushed open the door gently but the room was inhabited .

the entrance of macbeth did not destroy the illusion, for he was actuated by the same feelings that inspired us, and while the work of magic proceeded we sympathized in his wonder and his daring, and gave ourselves up with our whole souls to the influence of scenic delusion .
i could not however at that time feel remorse, for methought i was born anew; my soul threw off the burthen of past sin, to commence a new career in innocence and love .
a wind swept across the plain, i looked around me and saw no object that told me where i was; i had lost myself, and in vain attempted to find my path .
while life was strong within me i thought indeed that there was a sacred horror in my tale that rendered it unfit for utterance, and now about to die i pollute its mystic terrors .
 ''it was evening when i arrived, and i retired to a hiding place among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner i should apply to you .

she sometimes begged justine to forgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister .

some unknown circumstance now induced his mother to send him from under her immediate tutelage; and we heard that he was about to visit cumberland .
it was between six and seven o 'clock, a fine summer afternoon, and i spent my leisure hours in a ramble through the empty streets of london; now turning to avoid an approaching funeral, now urged by curiosity to observe the state of a particular spot; my wanderings were instinct with pain, for silence and desertion characterized every place i visited, and the few beings i met were so pale and woe begone, so marked with care and depressed by fear, that weary of encountering only signs of misery, i began to retread my steps towards home .
my daily vows rose for revenge a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish i had endured .
how altered every thing might be during that time one sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive .
professor krempe often asked me, with a sly smile, how cornelius agrippa went on, whilst m  . waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress.
i revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion .
if the worst befell; if she learnt the truth, he would neither stand her reproaches, or the anguish of her altered looks .
with considerable difficulty we scrambled up, and came to another passage with still more of illumination, and this led to another ascent like the former .
my life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during sleep alone that i could taste joy .
idris was as the star, set in single splendour in the dim anadem of balmy evening; ready to enlighten and delight the subject world, shielded herself from every taint by her unimagined distance from all that was not like herself akin to heaven .
his astronomical theories absorbed him; calculations were scrawled with coal on the bare walls of his garret: a hard earned guinea, or an article of dress, was exchanged for a book without remorse; he neither heard his children cry, nor observed his companion 's emaciated form, and the excess of calamity was merely to him as the occurrence of a cloudy night, when he would have given his right hand to observe a celestial phenomenon .
we entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld justine sitting on some straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on her knees .
sometimes i sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object which i so much dreaded to behold .
our rate could not have been less than eight knots .
if i ventured to enquire he would either leave me or press his finger on his lips, and with a deprecating look that i could not resist, turn away .
as i returned my fervent hopes were dashed by so many fears; my impatience became in the highest degree painful .
when i thought of my friends, of the mild voice of de lacey, the gentle eyes of agatha, and the exquisite beauty of the arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me .
 ''do you then intend, now in time of peril, to recede from your duties? ''  ''duties speak rationally, my lord when i am a plague spotted corpse, where will my duties be?

but he had promised to follow me wherever i might go, and would he not accompany me to england?
his paroxisms of passion were terrific but his soul bore him through them triumphant, though almost destroyed by victory; but the day would finally have been won had not i, foolish and presumtuous wretch hurried him on untill there was no recall, no hope .
the windows of the room had before been darkened, and i felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber .
i grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune; i felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months, calm and serene joy .
the crime had its source in her; be hers the punishment thanks to the lessons of felix and the sanguinary laws of man, i had learned now to work mischief .
while i still hung over her in the agony of despair, i happened to look up .
suddenly i became as it were the father of all mankind .
look at him ha i see plague she has invested his form, is incarnate in his flesh, has entwined herself with his being, and blinds his heaven seeking eyes .
the arrival of the arabian now infused new life into his soul .
or would my brother rather devote the heart broken perdita to the straw and chains of a maniac, than suffer her to rest in peace beneath the shadow of his society, in this my own selected and beloved recess? ''
this was a dire blow to poor elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon justine 's innocence .
such acts were not wanting to adorn the grim train that waited on the progress of the plague .
i have spent days and nights of festivity; i have joined in ambitious hopes, and exulted in victory: now, shut the door on the world, and build high the wall that is to separate me from the troubled scene enacted within its precincts .
they were forever ardent and craving; still i desired love and fellowship, and i was still spurned .
i shall expect your return by to morrow noon . ''
the mower 's scythe was at times heard; yet the joyless haymakers after they had listlessly turned the grass, forgot to cart it; the shepherd, when he had sheared his sheep, would let the wool lie to be scattered by the winds, deeming it useless to provide clothing for another winter .
i shall become a wanderer, a miserable outcast alone alone '' in another part of the letter he mentioned me  ''as for that unhappy little being whom i could not see, and hardly dare mention, i leave her under your protection .
the river swollen by autumnal rains, deluged the low lands, and adrian in his favourite boat is employed in the dangerous pastime of plucking the topmost bough from a submerged oak .
one only condition i would make, that you do nothing without his concurrence . ''
i passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country .
even now i cannot recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete .
shall two years more be thus passed, each day adding to our alienation, each act being another stone piled on the barrier which separates us?
a gigantic monster, they said, had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols, putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance .
in a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, i kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment .
i communed in this manner with myself, but i was silent to all around me .
i knew my silence disquieted them, and i well remembered the words of my father:  ''i know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from you .
as he went, he bought a basket of costly fruits, such as were natives of her own country, and throwing over these various beautiful flowers, bore it himself to the miserable garret of his friend .
i left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, i sought my own apartment .
study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children .
i desire the company of a man who could sympathize with me, whose eyes would reply to mine .
i lingered awhile, desirous of taking leave of perdita, and from my window observed the approach of the sun .
and although i could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit, i recollected what he had said of m  . waldman, whom i had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.
these then were the preparations for a battle, nay, the battle itself; far different from any thing the imagination had pictured .
the busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species .
tell me, lionel, do you consent that i should marry this young lady? ''
it was surely that i might fulfil my destiny, which is now drawing to a close .
the debate had ended at three in the morning .
we had many pitched battles, during which no word was spoken, hardly a look was interchanged, but in which each resolved not to submit to the other .
diana was fully worthy of his deepest affection .
oh fie cast off this blank look of human melancholy .
evening approached and i beheld the sun set .
i thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion, tore to pieces the thing on which i was engaged .
death snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb of what materials was i made that i could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the torture?
great god would it one day be thus?
there is something fearful in one who can thus conquer the animal part of our nature, if the victory be not the effect of consummate virtue; nor was it without a mixture of this feeling, that i beheld the figure of the countess awake when others slept, fasting when i, abstemious naturally, and rendered so by the fever that preyed on me, was forced to recruit myself with food .
hours passed, while in this scene of ruin i sought for raymond .
perdita presented her to raymond; her first words were:  ''beloved, embrace our child ''  ''come hither, sweet one, '' said her father,  ''do you not know me? '' she knew his voice, and cast herself in his arms with half bashful but uncontrollable emotion .
i consented to her request, and taking her little hand, followed raymond .
i knew all this and did not go to seek sympathy; but there on my solitary heath, under my lowly roof where all around was desart, it came to me as a sun beam in winter to adorn while it helps to dissolve the drifted snow .
habit would not dull his sense of the enjoyment of power; nor struggles, disappointment and defeat await the end of that which would expire at its maturity .
i had arrived from a weary wandering of sixteen years, during which, although i had gone through many dangers and misfortunes, my affections had been an entire blank .
he suspected, that unaccustomed poverty was the cause of the mystery, and that the artist was unwilling to be seen in the garb and abode of want .
the farmers and cottagers, on the contrary, struck with the fear of solitude, and madly desirous of medical assistance, flocked into the towns .
i can enchain the plague in limits, and set a term to the misery it would occasion; courage, forbearance, and watchfulness, are the forces i bring towards this great work .
still all his wishes and endeavours were directed towards her peace, and his chief discomfort arose from the perception that he exerted himself in vain .
peace, peace learn my miseries and do not seek to increase your own . ''
she could not divine, that the breach which she had occasioned between raymond and perdita was already irreparable: but she knew, that under the present system it would be widened each day, and that its result must be to destroy her lover 's happiness, and to implant the fangs of remorse in his heart .
now i am twenty eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen .
i also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; i imagined that i also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of homer and shakespeare are consecrated .
alas i must for ever conceal the wretchedness that consumes me .
there were periods, dreadful ones, during which i despaired doubted the existence of all duty the reality of crime but i shudder, and turn from the rememberance .
adrian was obliged to exert his utmost prudence, first to allay the discord, and then to provide for the multitude of the invaders .
i returned to windsor at the wish of idris, who seemed to think that there was greater safety for her children at that spot; and because, once having taken on me the guardianship of the district, i would not desert it while an inhabitant survived .
we accordingly rested on a seat until they should return .
if i grieved it was for your mother, if i loved it was your image; these sole emotions filled my heart in quietness .
once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle .
the form of the monster on whom i had bestowed existence was forever before my eyes, and i raved incessantly concerning him .
first, his having entered into any engagement that should permit her to remain in such a state of degradation; and then, after a short wild dream, having left her to drear solitude, anxious conjecture, and bitter, still disappointed expectation .
what would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?
at length, in an abrupt manner she asked,  ''where is he? ''  ''o, fear not, '' she continued,  ''fear not that i should entertain hope yet tell me, have you found him?
i had insisted on accompanying him across the heath towards the town where he dwelt: the sun was yet high when he left me, and i turned my steps towards my cottage .
i took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which i inhabited, where i remained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which i had so miserably given life .
on the evening previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said playfully,  ''i have a pretty present for my victor tomorrow he shall have it . ''
i passed the bridge of pelissier, where the ravine, which the river forms, opened before me, and i began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it .
and morning and evening my tearful eyes raised to heaven, my hands clasped tight in the energy of prayer, i have repeated with the poet before i see another day oh, let this body die away let me not be reproached then with inutility; i believed that by suicide i should violate a divine law of nature, and i thought that i sufficiently fulfilled my part in submitting to the hard task of enduring the crawling hours minutes in bearing the load of time that weighed miserably upon me and that in abstaining from what i in my calm moments considered a crime, i deserved the reward of virtue .
in answer to this question, i described our gloomy winter life, our sordid cares, our menial labours:  ''this northern country, '' i said,  ''is no place for our diminished race .
i am an unfortunate and deserted creature, i look around and i have no relation or friend upon earth .
her features had lost the distortion of grief; her eyes were brightened, her very person seemed dilated; while the excessive whiteness and even transparency of her skin, and something hollow in her voice, bore witness that not tranquillity, but excess of excitement, occasioned the treacherous calm that settled on her countenance .
 ''farewell for ever '' the moment i finished this letter i ordered the carriage and prepared to follow my father .
 ''the turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other plans .
we accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather .
the former protector tendered him the oaths, and presented him with the insignia of office, performing the ceremonies of installation .
i shuddered when i thought of the possible consequences of my consent, but i felt that there was some justice in his argument .
an aperture in the midst let in the light of heaven; but this was overgrown with brambles and underwood, which acted as a veil, obscuring the day, and giving a solemn religious hue to the apartment .
as this terrible conviction came upon him me? it melted my soul to tenderness and love i gazed on him as to take my last farewell he lay insensible his eyes closed as and? his cheeks deathly pale .
a great part of these grounds had been given to cultivation, and strips of potatoe land and corn were scattered here and there .
william, justine, and henry they all died by my hands . ''
among other painful restrictions, she has occasioned it to become a law among us, never to mention raymond 's name before her .
thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself .
no guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine .
as is common in communities, a fashion was set .
if we survive this coming summer, i will not spend the ensuing winter in england; neither i nor any of us . ''
his reckless courage and comprehensive genius brought him into notice .
i felt that they were near, that they were safe, yet methought this was all deceit; the earth reeled, the firm enrooted trees moved dizziness came over me i sank to the ground .
then the mark of misery would have faded from my brow, and i should raise my eyes fearlessly to meet his, which ever beamed with the soft lustre of innocent love .
i wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly .
i have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom i have already engaged appear to be men on whom i can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage .
if i saw him at a distance, riding a beautiful horse, my blood boiled with rage; the air seemed poisoned by his presence, and my very native english was changed to a vile jargon, since every phrase i heard was coupled with his name and honour .
but why should i repine at this? misery was my element, and nothing but what was miserable could approach me; if woodville had been happy i should never have known him .
perdita at length subdued her burst of passion, and rose, she looked round for clara; the child frightened, not recognizing her father, and neglected by us, had crept to the other end of the boat; she came at her mother 's call .
should i return to the castle, to my wife and children, with this taint upon me?
i was so entirely wrapt in this reverie that i wandered on, taking no heed of my steps until i actually stooped down to gather a flower for my wreath on that bleak plain where no flower grew, when i awoke from my day dream and found myself i knew not where .
this part of the rhine, indeed, presents a singularly variegated landscape .
i must own i felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services .
until this moment my soul had been in my eyes only .
at first, relieved from famine and the grave, watched over by raymond with the tenderest assiduity, with that feeling of repose peculiar to convalescence, evadne gave herself up to rapturous gratitude and love .
 ''you swear, '' i said,  ''to be harmless; but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you?
there was an eager delight in our tones and gestures that could only spring from deep mutual love joined to the most unrestrained confidence; and now the next day, the next hour, i saw his brows contracted, his eyes fixed in sullen fierceness on the ground, and his voice so gentle and so dear made me shiver when he addressed me .
at a distance from facts one draws conclusions which appear infallible, which yet when put to the test of reality, vanish like unreal dreams .
hope, and your wounds will be already half healed: but if you obstinately despair, there never more will be comfort for you .
our circle will be small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune .
i sought the little bed of my darling; he was oppressed by fever; but i trusted, i fondly and fearfully trusted, that there were no symptoms of the plague .
i will be brief for there is in all this a horror that will not bear many words, and i sink almost a second time to death while i recall these sad scenes to my memory .
since i last saw you i have been constantly employed in writing letters, and have several more to write; for i do not intend that any one shall hear of me after i depart .
our own distresses, though they were occasioned by the fictitious reciprocity of commerce, encreased in due proportion .
a strange idea seized me; a person must have felt all the agonies of doubt concerning the life and death of one who is the whole world to them before they can enter into my feelings for in that state, the mind working unrestrained by the will makes strange and fanciful combinations with outward circumstances and weaves the chances and changes of nature into an immediate connexion with the event they dread .
idris smiled her thanks, and rose to take leave .
 ''verney, '' said he,  ''my first act when i become king of england, will be to unite with the greeks, take constantinople, and subdue all asia .
such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures .
i am convinced that, at the worst, he would have returned from the seashore to take leave of us, and to make us the partners of his council .
the utter inutility that had attended all my exertions took from them their usual effects of exhilaration, and despair rendered abortive the balm of self applause i longed to return to my old occupations, but of what use were they?
i met a company of soldiers outside the walls; i borrowed a horse from one of them, and hastened to my sister .
he seemed born anew, and virtue, more potent than medean alchemy, endued him with health and strength .
i will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as i then was, to your destruction and infallible misery .
in the mean time what did perdita?
years passed thus, even years .
soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, i shall also sink to rest .
we were born to be friends to each other; and though ill fortune has divided us, will you not acknowledge the hereditary bond of friendship which i trust will hereafter unite us? ''
to leave england for ever to turn from its polluted fields and groves, and, placing the sea between us, to quit it, as a sailor quits the rock on which he has been wrecked, when the saving ship rides by .
i do not die not having enjoyed life; for sixteen years i was happy: during the first months of my father 's return i had enjoyed ages of pleasure: now indeed i am grown old in grief; my steps are feeble like those of age; i have become peevish and unfit for life; so having passed little more than twenty years upon the earth i am more fit for my narrow grave than many are when they reach the natural term of their lives .
the soul of tender sorrow is breathed forth in this strain; and the sweet voice of idris, sustained by the mournful chords of her instrument, added to the expression of the words .
on that night he had determined to consummate his crimes by my death .
raymond, stopping mid way in his wild career, paused suddenly to think of consequences .
families, bred in opulence and luxury, were reduced to beggary .
she grew weaker each day, and each day she had further to go .
he came to a part of the country where he was entirely unknown and where in the deepest solitude he could converse only with his own heart .
if, therefore, i could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend, i should not be so desolate in this peopled earth .
we are told by the wisest philosophers of the dangers of the world, the deceits of men, and the treason of our own hearts: but not the less fearlessly does each put off his frail bark from the port, spread the sail, and strain his oar, to attain the multitudinous streams of the sea of life .
my thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own elevated and gentle manners have created .
he had schemed, if he failed in his present attempt, without taking leave of any of us, to embark for greece, and never again to revisit england .
but the powers of love, poetry, and creative fancy will dwell even beside the sick of the plague, with the squalid, and with the dying .
many of these, of high rank in their own countries, now, with hoe in hand, turned up the soil .
justine, poor unhappy justine, was as innocent as i, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and i am the cause of this i murdered her .
taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money, she quitted italy with an attendant, a native of leghorn, but who understood the common language of turkey, and departed for germany .
he bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them .
oh, beloved father accept the pure heart of your unhappy daughter; permit me to join you unspotted as i was or you will not recognize my altered semblance .
besides, she had memories of past tenderness to cherish, smiles, words, and even tears, to con over, which, though remembered in desertion and sorrow, were to be preferred to the forgetfulness of the grave .
yet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered through me .
among some these changes produced a devotion and sacrifice of self at once graceful and heroic .
 ''my heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which would decide my hopes or realize my fears .
the work was soon finished; in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and i was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death .
many men may scoff at his dread; but he read the future; and the peace of perdita was too dear to him, her speechless agony too certain, and too fearful, not to unman him .
but man is a strange animal .
as i sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of what i was now doing .
and now it is ended; there is my last victim '' i was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when i called to mind what frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion, and when i again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend, indignation was rekindled within me .
yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?
i contracted my view to england .
why did he write them?
where can any of us go? ''
i panted for enterprises beyond my childish exploits, and formed distempered dreams of future action .
the intense life that quickened my pulses, and animated my frame, had the effect, not of drawing me into the mazes of active life, but of exalting my lowliness, and of bestowing majestic proportions on insignificant objects i could have lived the life of a peasant in the same way my trifling occupations were swelled into important pursuits; my affections were impetuous and engrossing passions, and nature with all her changes was invested in divine attributes .
with sails abaft, the engine stopt, the vessel remained unwillingly stationary, until, after an hour 's search, my poor perdita was brought on board .
he manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared; but i have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere .
enter the house of mourning, my friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not with hatred for your enemies .
 ''there he lies, white and cold in death .
yet could england indeed doff her lordly trappings, and be content with the democratic style of america?
to the generality of spectators he appeared careless of censure, and with high disdain to throw aside all dependance on public prejudices; but at the same time that he strode with a triumphant stride over the rest of the world, he cowered, with self disguised lowliness, to his own party, and although its chief never dared express an opinion or a feeling until he was assured that it would meet with the approbation of his companions .
 ''and we shall of course enjoy the benefit of the change, '' said ryland, contemptuously .
light grew dim in these close streets, and when the well known door was opened, the staircase was shrouded in perfect night .
did the sun shine on any, who could enjoy its light with purer and more intense bliss?
the question was no longer whether i should share adrian 's toils and danger; but in what manner i could, in windsor and the neighbourhood, imitate the prudence and zeal which, under his government, produced order and plenty in london, and how, now pestilence had spread more widely, i could secure the health of my own family .
sometimes i could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days, and at other times i toiled day and night in order to complete my work .
 ''i agree with you, '' replied the stranger;  ''we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves such a friend ought to be do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures .
 ''devil, '' i exclaimed,  ''do you dare approach me?
did we pass a valley?
believe me, i was then less fitted for any communion with my fellow creatures than before .
and thus for a time i was occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas .
she replied,  ''at athens; even at the athens which he loved .
to a crown, a golden be gemmed crown, i hope; and yet i dare not trust and though i dream of a crown and wake for one, ever and anon a busy devil whispers to me, that it is but a fool 's cap that i seek, and that were i wise, i should trample on it, and take in its stead, that which is worth all the crowns of the east and presidentships of the west . ''
in the evening, adrian and i proceeded to westminster .
all was serene, burning, annihilating .
all delightful things, sublime scenery, soft breezes, exquisite music seemed to me associated with you and only through you to be pleasant to me .
i had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body .
the darkness was much dissipated and in the east where the clouds were least dense the moon was visible behind the thin grey cloud the moon is behind, and at the full and yet she looks both small and dull .
i shall shed no more tears for my task is almost fulfilled, and i am about to be rewarded for long and most burthensome suffering .
in spite of her tender nursing, the health of adrian perceptibly declined .
he looked upon me, however, with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors, he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion .
i left the house, the horrid scene of the last night 's contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which i almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me .
i had tutored myself, and was resolved by no outward sign to disclose my internal agitation .
my return had only been delayed so long, from an unwillingness to leave clerval in a strange place, before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants .
i felt this delay very bitterly; for i longed to see my native town and my beloved friends .
on seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood .
idris appeared to be the only being who could resist her mother, notwithstanding the extreme mildness of her character .
     '''do you consider,' said his companion to him, 'that you will be obliged to pay three months' rent and to lose the produce of your garden?
she was not sanguine, but secure; and the expectation of seeing the lover she had banished, the husband, friend, heart 's companion from whom she had long been alienated, wrapt her senses in delight, her mind in placidity .
and could not such words from her whom i fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart?
since our encampment here, she daily, hourly visits my thoughts .
evelyn, a laughing cherub, a gamesome infant, without idea of pain or sorrow, would, shaking back his light curls from his eyes, make the halls re echo with his merriment, and in a thousand artless ways attract our attention to his play .
there was much of degradation in this: for even vice and virtue had lost their attributes life life the continuation of our animal mechanism was the alpha and omega of the desires, the prayers, the prostrate ambition of human race .
i wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed .
in spite of resentment, by day and night she figured to herself the toils and dangers of the wanderers .
i vowed, with energy and truth, to devote myself in life and death to the restoration and welfare of adrian .
as she walked along, seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence .
i did not know the names of the towns that i was to pass through, nor could i ask information from a single human being; but i did not despair .
the first ranks had muskets; some were mounted, but their arms were such as they had seized during their advance, their horses those they had taken from the peasantry; there was no uniformity, and little obedience, but their shouts and wild gestures showed the untamed spirit that inspired them .
and then i bent over her and whispered,   'awake, fairest, thy lover is near he who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my beloved, awake'  ''the sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me .
our evening march, more calm, was yet more delightful than the morning restlessness of spirit .
continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity: i may receive your letters on some occasions when i need them most to support my spirits .
no wood, however, was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, i found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain .
the faces of many of the inhabitants were familiar to me; in the towns, plains, hills, and defiles of these countries, i had enjoyed unspeakable delight, as i journied through them the year before .
after a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge, i prepared for my journey .
the golden splendour arose, and weary nature awoke to suffer yet another day of heat and thirsty decay .
he says all hope is dead to him, and i know that it is dead to me, so we are both equally fitted for death .
yet, before i departed, there was a task to perform, on which i shuddered to reflect; i must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose i must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and i must handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me .
at the same time, lord raymond, by some unlooked for chance, became the possessor of an immense fortune in england, whither he returned, crowned with glory, to receive the meed of honour and distinction before denied to his pretensions .
 ''yet i cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil this task; and now that you are returning to england, you will have little chance of meeting with him .
or after life no, no, i will not persuade myself to die, i may not, dare not .
at other times he worked in the garden, but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old man and agatha .
but do not mourn, dear girl .
 ''i have lived my last winter, and the date of this year, , will be carved upon my tomb .
frost would blunt the arrows of pestilence, and enchain the furious elements; and the land would in spring throw off her garment of snow, released from her menace of destruction .
day dawned; and i directed my steps towards the town .
this was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months .
 ''that evidence, '' he observed,  ''was hardly required in so glaring a case, but i am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so decisive . ''
he won me over to his party, heart and soul .
happiness, love and peace, walked the forest paths, and tempered the atmosphere .
 ''thus i relieve thee, my creator, '' he said, and placed his hated hands before my eyes, which i flung from me with violence;  ''thus i take from thee a sight which you abhor .
i entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin .
i performed the first part of my journey on horseback .
to chambers of painted state farewell to midnight revelry, and the panting emulation of beauty, to costly dress and birth day shew, to title and the gilded coronet, farewell farewell to the giant powers of man, to knowledge that could pilot the deep drawing bark through the opposing waters of shoreless ocean, to science that directed the silken balloon through the pathless air, to the power that could put a barrier to mighty waters, and set in motion wheels, and beams, and vast machinery, that could divide rocks of granite or marble, and make the mountains plain farewell to the arts, to eloquence, which is to the human mind as the winds to the sea, stirring, and then allaying it; farewell to poetry and deep philosophy, for man   's imagination is cold, and his enquiring mind can no longer expatiate on the wonders of life, for  ''there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave, whither thou goest '' to the graceful building, which in its perfect proportion transcended the rude forms of nature, the fretted gothic and massy saracenic pile, to the stupendous arch and glorious dome, the fluted column with its capital, corinthian, ionic, or doric, the peristyle and fair entablature, whose harmony of form is to the eye as musical concord to the ear farewell to sculpture, where the pure marble mocks human flesh, and in the plastic expression of the culled excellencies of the human shape, shines forth the god farewell to painting, the high wrought sentiment and deep knowledge of the artists's mind in pictured canvas to paradisaical scenes, where trees are ever vernal, and the ambrosial air rests in perpetual glow: to the stamped form of tempest, and wildest uproar of universal nature encaged in the narrow frame, o farewell farewell to music, and the sound of song; to the marriage of instruments, where the concord of soft and harsh unites in sweet harmony, and gives wings to the panting listeners, whereby to climb heaven, and learn the hidden pleasures of the eternals farewell to the well trod stage; a truer tragedy is enacted on the world's ample scene, that puts to shame mimic grief: to high bred comedy, and the low buffoon, farewell man may laugh no more .
you are dear to us, because you wear the frail shape of humanity; each one among you will find a friend and host among these forces .
sleeping thus under the beneficent eye of heaven, can evil visit thee, o earth, or grief cradle to their graves thy luckless children?
he was, as it were, now awakened from his long, visionary sleep, and he felt some what like one of the seven sleepers, or like nourjahad, in that sweet imitation of an eastern tale: diana was gone; his friends were changed or dead, and now on his awakening i was all that he had to love on earth .
the scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land, but i sailed away from them .
but on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which i had promised to reveal to her on the following day .
with an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, i collected the instruments of life around me, that i might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet .
turning towards the men, he said,  ''what do you mean?
with eagerness one turns toward the east, with angry impatience one marks the unchequered darkness; the crowing of a cock, that sound of glee during day time, comes wailing and untuneable the creaking of rafters, and slight stir of invisible insect is heard and felt as the signal and type of desolation .
sometimes it would be in a desart; in a populous city; at a ball; we should perhaps meet in a vessel; and his first words constantly were,  ''my daughter, i love thee '' what extactic moments have i passed in these dreams how many tears i have shed; how often have i laughed aloud .
what are we, the inhabitants of this globe, least among the many that people infinite space?
but the weather was serene, and as i walked on i fell into no unpleasing reveries .
what then became of me?
 ''nor are outward objects alone the receptacles of the spirit of good .
five months after their arrival in england, he committed suicide .
this spot, dedicated to sweetest recollections, the deserted house and neglected garden were well adapted to nurse my melancholy .
promise, '' and he raised himself painfully, and seized my arm,  ''promise to bury me with them . ''
if his appearance even inspired us with hope, it only rendered the state of her mind more painful .
i signified my readiness to proceed, but our guides protested against such a measure .
already do i see, '' he continued, looking up mournfully,  ''the bourne and precipitate edge of my existence, over which i plunge into the gloomy mystery of the life to come .
stranger still, some were in modern dialects, english and italian .
prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous .
it was a subject of regret to me whenever we were joined by a third person, yet if i turned with a disturbed look towards my father, his eyes fixed on me and beaming with tenderness instantly restored joy to my heart .
 ''why do you answer me so roughly? ''
soon after my arrival in the hovel i discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which i had taken from your laboratory .
i remembered also the nervous fever with which i had been seized just at the time that i dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable .
they were her life; dearer than a spot consecrated to love, dearer than all else the earth contained .
it was here that charles i  . had collected his forces.
my answer to these questions must needs appear to you unsatisfactory, yet they have sufficed to lead me on, day after day, enduring every wretchedness, rather than by such means to seek relief .
the tide of love towards her appeared to flow again; he could never forget, how once he had been devoted to her, making her the shrine and storehouse wherein to place every thought and every sentiment .
at length all was veiled in the deep obscurity of blackest night; i became weary and knowing that my servant was to sleep that night at the neighbouring village, so that my absence would alarm no one; and that i was safe in this wild spot from every intruder, i resolved to spend the night where i was .
he was conspicuous for his conduct and choice of position in a battle fought in the plains of thrace, on the banks of the hebrus, which was to decide the fate of islam .
he slowly recovered himself; yet, at last, as one might from the effects of poison, he lifted his head from above the vapours of fever and passion into the still atmosphere of calm reflection .
 ''as he approached his desire of seeing me, '' he said,  ''became more and more ardent, and he felt that the moment when he should first clasp me in his arms would be the happiest of his life . ''
separated from them; exalted in my heart; sole possessor of my affections; single object of my hopes, the best half of myself .
all was silent in and around the cottage; it was an excellent opportunity; yet, when i proceeded to execute my plan, my limbs failed me and i sank to the ground .
my sister was by nature destitute of the common feelings of anxious, petulant jealousy .
she studiously shut out all prospect of the future, and cradled her heart in present blessings .
neither yours nor any man 's death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done, but it requires my own .
he had also changed my apartment; for he perceived that i had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory .
besides, though the violence of her anguish made life hateful, it had not yet produced that monotonous, lethargic sense of changeless misery which for the most part produces suicide .
i hardly replied to the slightest question, and was uneasy when i saw a human creature near me .
still they would not capitulate .
his emissary obeyed, and brought the desired intelligence .
it is a scene terrifically desolate .
his sentence was pronounced, and i could only grieve and be patient .
i hardly know, but in a few moments i sank lifeless to the ground; and so would that then all had been at an end chapter viii i was carried to the next town: fever succeeded to convulsions and faintings, for some weeks my unhappy spirit hovered on the very verge of death .
the girl was called           'sister' or 'agatha,' and the youth 'felix,' 'brother,' or 'son .'
master yourself, raymond, and the world is subject to you  . ''  ''all this would be very good sense, if addressed to another, '' replied raymond, moodily,  ''con the lesson yourself, and you, the first peer of the land, may become its sovereign.
i have a mother whose support and hope i am .
the plague had come to athens .
when our exiles had first arrived, a truce was in existence between the turks and greeks; a truce that was as sleep to the mortal frame, signal of renewed activity on waking .
he seemed the favourite child of fortune, and his untimely loss eclipsed the world, and shewed forth the remnant of mankind with diminished lustre .
i had returned from london possessed by the idea, with the intimate feeling that it was my first duty to secure, as well as i was able, the well being of my family, and then to return and take my post beside adrian .
i, not in deed, but in effect, was the true murderer .
clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to ingolstadt .
my imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities i conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man .
by degrees, our eyes grew somewhat accustomed to this dimness, and we perceived that there was no direct passage leading us further; but that it was possible to climb one side of the cavern to a low arch at top, which promised a more easy path, from whence we now discovered that this light proceeded .
if he had permitted us to witness his agitation, he would have been more under the guidance of reason; but his struggles for the shew of composure, acted with such violence on his nerves, as to destroy his power of self command .
besides that, with the nearly extinct race of man, all our toils grew near a conclusion, she was too weak; consumption, if so it might be called, or rather the over active life within her, which, as with adrian, spent the vital oil in the early morning hours, deprived her limbs of strength .
idris arose also, and bent on me her eyes of celestial blue, and with grace peculiar said  ''you hardly need an introduction; we have a picture, highly valued by my father, which declares at once your name .
my father pointed out these circumstances with a serious and unaltered mien, only now and then fixing his deep and liquid eyes upon me; there was something strange and awful in his look that overcame me, and in spite of myself i wept, nor did he attempt to console me, but i saw his lips quiver and the muscles of his countenance seemed convulsed .
how pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our ernest he is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit .
 ''several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage .
i shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames .
in after sorrow or joy, believe that you father 's spirit is near, to save or sympathize with you .
his desire of restoring his lovely friend to her rank in society, and to her lost prosperity, animated him, and he poured forth with energy, all his wishes and intentions on that subject .
i quitted him to take a few hours rest .
as for those who in your world knew not the loveliness of benevolence justice they are placed apart some claimed by the evil spirit in vain sought for by the good but she whose delight is to reform the wicked takes all she can delivers them to her ministers not to be punished but to be exercised instructed untill acquiring a love of virtue they are fitted for these gardens where they will acquire a love of knowledge as fantasia talked i saw various groupes of figures as they walked among the allies of the gardens or were seated on the grassy plots either in contemplation or conversation several advanced together towards the fountain where i sat as they approached i observed the principal figure to be that of a woman about years of age her eyes burned with a deep fire and every line of her face expressed enthusiasm wisdom try seemed seated on her lips which were beautifully formed every motion of her limbs although not youthful was inexpressibly graceful her black hair was bound in tresses round her head and her brows were encompassed by a fillet her dress was that of a simple tunic bound at the waist by a broad girdle and a mantle which fell over her left arm she was encompassed by several youths of both sexes who appeared to hang on her words to catch the inspiration as it flowed from her with looks either of eager wonder or stedfast attention with eyes all bent towards her eloquent countenance which beamed with the mind within i am going said fantasia but i leave my spirit with you without which this scene wd fade away i leave you in good company that female whose eyes like the loveliest planet in the heavens draw all to gaze on her is the prophetess diotima the instructress of socrates the company about her are those just escaped from the world there they were unthinking or misconducted in the pursuit of knowledge .
i adjure you, my father, has not an unnatural passion seized upon your heart?
like to our first parents, the whole earth is before him, a wide desart .
as i came, dressed in white, covered only by my tartan rachan, my hair streaming on my shoulders, and shooting across with greater speed that it could be supposed i could give to my boat, my father has often told me that i looked more like a spirit than a human maid .
when shown the body, she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days .
i must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful events which i am about to relate, in proper detail, to my recollection .
oh, how i longed then for the dear soothings of maternal nature, as my wounded heart was still further stung by the roar of heartless merriment from the public house, by the sight of the drunkard reeling home, having lost the memory of what he would find there in oblivious debauch, and by the more appalling salutations of those melancholy beings to whom the name of home was a mockery .
he was ready to go back to old times, and commemorate the contests of our fathers, and the monarch 's abdication .
i feared also that it might be some one who had seen me before: i might be recognized, my impostures discovered and i dragged back to a life of worse torture than that i had before endured .
mr  . kirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion.
think you, amidst the shrieks of violated innocence and helpless infancy, i did not feel in every nerve the cry of a fellow being?
other feelings, less ambiguous, were called into play by his conciliating manner and the generous warmth of his expressions, respect rarely before experienced, admiration, and love he had touched my rocky heart with his magic power, and the stream of affection gushed forth, imperishable and pure .
his kingdom was the heart of perdita, his subjects her thoughts; by her he was loved, respected as a superior being, obeyed, waited on .
still the same lofty domes and minarets towered above the verdurous walls, where constantine had died, and the turk had entered the city .
take the colours and odour from the rose, change the sweet nutriment of mother 's milk to gall and poison; as easily might you wean perdita from love .
idris sat at the top of the half empty hall .
so we retired awhile to eleusis, and here rest and tender care added each day to the strength of our invalid .
he sat at a table with several secretaries, who were arranging petitions, or registering the notes made during that day 's audience .
lie down, o man, on the flower strown earth; give up all claim to your inheritance, all you can ever possess of it is the small cell which the dead require .
our silence endured for some miles, till the country with open fields, or shady woods and parks, presented pleasant objects to our view .
the night before, she had reached datchet; and, prowling about, had found a baker 's shop open and deserted .
yet when he returned thence, and first appeared in public life in england, her love did not purchase his, which then vacillated between perdita and a crown .
and now i began to live .
this was asked only half ironically; and idris wondered why her mother should extort from her a solemn vow not to do, what she had never dreamed of doing but the promise was required and given .
she attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver .
if our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us .
let us not for a moment forget our object and our hope; and they will form a resistless mound to stop the overflowing of our regret for trifles . ''
this proved however to be a second passage, which evidently ascended .
the contest was keen and doubtful .
and will a contented conscience compensate for fallen hopes a slandered name torn affections all the miseries of civilized life?
now i must fulfil my vow; now range myself at his side, and be his ally and support till death .
i bestowed on him all my affections; there was a miniature of him that i gazed on continually; i copied his last letter and read it again and again .
a moment more and perdita appeared; she stood before me in the fresh bloom of youthful womanhood, different from and yet the same as the mountain girl i had left .
after the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my father 's, but it was agreed that elizabeth and i should commence our journey by water, sleeping that night at evian and continuing our voyage on the following day .
i was on deck, enjoying our swift progress .
i avoided you, you know i did, but you forced yourself upon me and gave me those wants which you see with triumph give you power over me .
i found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds .
they found me curius like, feasting on sorry fruits for supper; but they brought gifts richer than the golden bribes of the sabines, nor could i refuse the invaluable store of friendship and delight which they bestowed .
look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom .
she sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods .
 ''such were the events that preyed on the heart of felix and rendered him, when i first saw him, the most miserable of his family .
  ''it was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from labour the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to him that i observed the countenance of felix was melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father paused in his music, and i conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his son's sorrow .
when any separation took place between us, it generally so happened, that idris and perdita would ramble away together, and we remained to discuss the affairs of nations, and the philosophy of life .
many changes also now occurred in these spontaneous regal elections: depositions and abdications were frequent, while, in the place of the old and prudent, the ardent youth would step forward, eager for action, regardless of danger .
while we were in london there was a harshness and sulleness in his sorrow which had now entirely disappeared .
i began also to observe, with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me .
chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that i have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, i have not neglected the other branches of science .
we watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice .
each individual, before a part of a great whole moving only in unison with others, now became resolved into the unit nature had made him, and thought of himself only .
i observed the door of a small out house a jar .
look on me as dead; and truly if death be a mere change of state, i am dead .
but, no, my tale must not pause; it must be as rapid as was my fate, i can only describe in short although strong expressions my precipitate and irremediable change from happiness to despair .
the appearance of justine was calm .
raymond sprung lightly on his horse, grasped the standard, and with words which i could not hear but his gestures, being their fit accompaniment, were marked by passionate energy, he seemed to adjure their assistance and companionship; even as he spoke, the crowd receded from him .
winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but i did not watch the blossom or the expanding leaves sights which before always yielded me supreme delight so deeply was i engrossed in my occupation .
raymond yielded for the present .
i profited of this time to rest for a few hours .
adrian remained in the coffee room, while i, in compliance with his desire, took my seat in st  . stephen 's.
one subject what could it be?
she was frightened by his gaiety, for she dreaded a greater revulsion at the end .
before, i had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and a not less terrible, disaster .
 ''yet, as i have said, i should be best pleased, at least for the present, to live under the same roof with you .
i pressed on, but in vain .
the studied immovability of her countenance; her slow, equable manner, and soft but unmelodious voice, were a mask, hiding her fiery passions, and the impatience of her disposition .
a strange star, my lionel, ruled our birth; sadly and with dismay we may look upon the annihilation of man; but we remain for each other .
the sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river drance and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills .
with summer and mortality grew our fears .
the labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind . ''
with great volubility, in their native neapolitan dialect, with which we were not very familiar, they told us that there were spectres, that the roof would fall in, that it was too narrow to admit us, that there was a deep hole within, filled with water, and we might be drowned .
you do not treat me with candour; it is not true what you say; this will not soon pass away, it will last forever if you deign not to speak to me; to admit my consolations .
the joyful welcome of my boys, the soft gratulation of clara, the pressure of adrian 's hand, contributed to unman me .
the quiet was disturbed only by the rush of waters as they divided before the steady keel, the murmur of the moveless and full sails, the wind whistling in the shrouds, and the regular motion of the engine .
i would betake me with them to some wild beast  's den, where a tyger's cubs, which i would slay, had been reared in health .
his voice expressed the deepest compassion:  ''thou most unaccountable being, '' i cried,  ''whither will thy actions tend, in all this maze of purpose in which thou seemest lost? ''  ''whither indeed?
how can i see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief?
some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and recognized, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the lighthearted gaiety of boyhood .
the tramp of horses, distinctly heard in the silence, was at length discerned .
wit, hilarity, and deep observation were mingled in his talk, rendering every sentence that he uttered as a flash of light .
i cannot lead on to battle; i cannot, through intrigue and faithlessness rear again the throne upon the wreck of english public spirit .
her country, its ancient annals, its late memorable struggles, were all made to partake in her glory and excellence .
snow fell, and the waters were hardened, but i rested not .
two months after my aunt 's death we removed to london where i was led by my father to attend to deeper studies than had before occupied me .
discipline was lost; the army disbanded itself .
as we talked thus, i perceived that we were not going the ordinary road to windsor, but through englefield green, towards bishopgate heath .
to you alone do i dare speak; i have heard you commended by impartial spectators; you are my brother 's friends, therefore you must be mine .
as a last effort, my sister mustered her strength, her firmness; she stepped from one boat to the other, and then with a shriek she sprang towards raymond, knelt at his side, and glueing her lips to the hand she seized, her face shrouded by her long hair, gave herself up to tears .
i had already been three months in prison, and although i was still weak and in continual danger of a relapse, i was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the court was held .
the air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, i with a heavy heart and depressed spirits .
my work is nearly complete .
i threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose .
i could read the influence of my friend in their quickened motions and cheerful faces .
i revolved many projects, but that on which i finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone .
they shall behold the antipodes of what is real for i will appear to live while i am dead . ''
i was awake, and during the long hours of dead night, my busy thoughts worked in my brain, like ten thousand mill wheels, rapid, acute, untameable .
all of soul inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every thought .
adrian and idris saw this; they attributed it to my long watching and anxiety; they urged me to rest, and take care of myself, while i most truly assured them, that my best medicine was their good wishes; those, and the assured convalescence of my friend, now daily more apparent .
to night the question is to be decided, as there is a call of the house for the purpose .
it was not it is not a common infidelity at which i repine .
i passed through the gap of the broken paling i felt, while i disdained, the choaking tears i rushed into the depths of the forest .
even so will i brave the plague and though no man follow, i will plant the grecian standard on the height of st  . sophia. ''
she was carried thus unconscious on board; the anchor weighed, and the wind being favourable, we stood far out to sea; with all the canvas spread, and the power of the engine to assist, we scudded swiftly and steadily through the chafed element .
clouds hid the moon, everything was obscure, and i heard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time i slept soundly .
 ''no, no, '' he said,  ''do not deceive yourself, me you cannot .
he beholds in me one whom he has injured even unto death; and i derive no hope from his kindness; no change can possibly be brought about even by his best intentions .
i shall immediately depart for dunkeld . ''
a nervous fever was the consequence; during which he was nursed by the daughter of a poor cottager, under whose roof he lodged .
two results presented themselves in the view he took of the future .
i shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which, from what i had been, have made me what i am .
the greek took it, but he handled it in no artist like way; at length he said:  ''i must confess to you, my lord, that i did not make this drawing .
the sky was blue above, and the air impregnated with fragrance by the rare flowers that grew among the weeds .
one word, in truth, had alarmed her more than battles or sieges, during which she trusted raymond 's high command would exempt him from danger .
he was sent to eton and afterwards to college; allowed from childhood the free use of large sums of money; thus enjoying from his earliest youth the independance which a boy with these advantages, always acquires at a public school .
adrian observed a change during a visit that he afterward paid them; but he could not tell its extent, or divine the cause .
but, no, it is not so; i have my mathilda, my consolation, and my hope . ''
who was i? what was i? whence did i come?
at night, when she could leave me unperceived, she wandered through the house, or hung over the couches of her children; and in the day time would sink into a perturbed sleep, while her murmurs and starts betrayed the unquiet dreams that vexed her .
i ask if in the calm of their measured reveries, if in the deep meditations which fill their hours, they feel the extasy of a youthful tyro in the school of pleasure?
i observed, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden .
in one corner, near a small fire, sat an old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude .
 ''alas '' said the old man, who gave me this account with tears in his eyes,  ''it wrings my heart to see my lord in this state: when i heard that he was coming down here with you, my young lady, i thought we should have the happy days over again that we enjoyed during the short life of my lady your mother but that would be too much happiness for us poor creatures born to tears and that was why she was taken from us so soon; she was too beautiful and good for us .
i could only do this on foot, as the mass of ruin was impracticable for a horse .
the winter, however, was spent cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness .
chapter ii i now come to my own story .
we passed a considerable period at oxford, rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of english history .
farewell, raymond; be happy in having chosen the better part in life .
war was at last tacitly acknowledged between us .
already she fears for us .
but this was not the time for delay; i disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an hour 's rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me, i continued my route .
 ''ah, raymond, were we not happy?
we quitted london on the th of march and remained a few days at windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest .
when i returned, as often as it was necessary, i cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that i had seen done by felix .
 ''i continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until i came to its boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring .
but for one thing he would have been completely triumphant .
it was found, that, though at first the stop put to all circulation of property, had reduced those before supported by the factitious wants of society to sudden and hideous poverty, yet when the boundaries of private possession were thrown down, the products of human labour at present existing were more, far more, than the thinned generation could possibly consume .
i do not know that any will peruse these pages except you, my friend, who will receive them at my death .
 ''mad and foolish boy '' exclaimed the angry lady,  ''you have chosen with dreams and theories to overthrow my schemes for your own aggrandizement; but you shall not do the same by those i have formed for your sister .
i gnashed my teeth and ground them together, uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul .
can my soul, inextricably linked to this perishable frame, become lethargic and cold, even as this sensitive mechanism shall lose its youthful elasticity?
chapter i sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just rising from the sea; i had not sufficient light for my employment, and i remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether i should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it .
i told him of the business of the evening, and a smile relaxed the contracted muscles .
the peasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding places to seek for prey .
i admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers, but i was shut out from intercourse with them, except through means which i obtained by stealth, when i was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire i had of becoming one among my fellows .
alas for these latter days the world had grown old, and all its inmates partook of the decrepitude .
above all, the anxious mother, my own beloved and drooping idris, claimed my earnest care; i could not reproach the anxiety that never for a moment slept in her heart, but i exerted myself to distract her attention from too keen an observation of the truth of things, of the near and nearer approaches of disease, misery, and death, of the wild look of our attendants as intelligence of another and yet another death reached us; for to the last something new occurred that seemed to transcend in horror all that had gone before .
i related my adventures of the night, my endeavours to find our lost one, and my disappointment .
her whole appearance awakened his deepest interest .
when idris entered, so far had raymond forgotten himself, that he asked for my sister; one word, which told of her mysterious disappearance, recalled him .
you, who fancy that you can read the human soul, as your native lake reads each crevice and folding of its surrounding hills say what you think of me; king expectant, angel or devil, which? ''
one of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty .
alas i could never have believed that it was indeed elinor that died if once when i spoke she had not lifted her almost benighted eyes, and for one moment like nought beside on earth, more lovely than a sunbeam, slighter, quicker than the waving plumage of a bird, dazzling as lightning and like it giving day to night, yet mild and faint, that smile came; it went, and then there was an end of all joy to me . ''
it was through her beloved lessons that he cast off his old pursuits and gradually formed himself to become one among his fellow men; a distinguished member of society, a patriot; and an enlightened lover of truth and virtue .
 ''for some days i haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place, sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries forever .
i, their eldest child, was born at naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles .
to you first entering on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand what i have felt and still feel?
nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; i began to reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my release, i repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that i had an accusation to make, that i knew the destroyer of my family, and that i required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer .
fear has been said to be the parent of religion: even of that religion is it the generator, which leads its votaries to sacrifice human victims at its altars; but the religion which springs from happiness is a lovelier growth; the religion which makes the heart breathe forth fervent thanksgiving, and causes us to pour out the overflowings of the soul before the author of our being; that which is the parent of the imagination and the nurse of poetry; that which bestows benevolent intelligence on the visible mechanism of the world, and makes earth a temple with heaven for its cope .
still i would not hurry on; i would pause for ever on the recollections of these happy weeks; i would repeat every word, and how many do i remember, record every enchantment of the faery habitation .
this morning, as i sat watching the wan countenance of my friend his eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly i was roused by half a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin .
the queen 's dextrous management was employed to prolong these absences, and gather together accusations .
she was alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him, when the gates of geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known .
she was the living spirit of love to soften and attract; i might have become sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness .
if his heart had slept but a few years longer, he might have been saved; but it awoke in its infancy; it had power, but no knowledge; and it was ruined, even as a too early blowing bud is nipt by the killing frost .
but he was impatient of the years that must intervene, he was frank of heart and fearless .
how sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as i am it removes more than half my misfortune, and i feel as if i could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin . ''
she listened to me as she had done to the narration of my adventures, and sometimes took an interest in this species of information; but she did not, as i did, look on it as an integral part of her being, which having obtained, i could no more put off than the universal sense of touch .
can the ship wrecked mariner, who spent with swimming, hears close behind the splashing waters divided by a shark which pursues him through the atlantic, hope?
the glory of life was gone for her; the roseate halo of love, which had imbued every object with its own colour, faded; she was content to take life as it was, and to make the best of leaden coloured reality .
my alliance with him was the pledge of my sincerity, my union with his sister, my children, his presumptive heirs, were the hostages of my truth .
i then reflected, and the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom i had left in my apartment might still be there, alive and walking about .
it was more common, for all who possessed landed property to secede to their estates, attended by whole troops of the indigent, to cut down their woods to erect temporary dwellings, and to portion out their parks, parterres and flower gardens, to necessitous families .
order, comfort, and even health, rose under his influence, as from the touch of a magician 's wand .
adrian was now fifteen years of age .
my father felt this kindness; for a moment ambitious dreams floated before him; and he thought that it would be well to exchange his present pursuits for nobler duties .
the idea of this visit was torture to me, yet i could not refuse .
come with me to my room; we will remain there till the hour agreed upon . ''
she refused with a smile, reminding him that for the present his sister had promised to be patient .
soon, alas was one to conquer .
their occasional deaths filled my infant heart with anguish .
if she is condemned, i never shall know joy more .
if this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure .
its presence gave me a hope that by its means i might find my home .
new feelings had arisen within her, which she was unable to express in writing to one whom she had only known in childhood; but we saw each other again, and our intimacy was renewed as if nothing had intervened to check it .
i was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, i thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt .
i took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, i know not how .
the nature of riches and influence forcibly confined the list of candidates to a few of the wealthiest; and it was much to be feared, that the ill humour and contention generated by this triennial struggle, would counterbalance its advantages in impartial eyes .
high aspirations cause the flow of my blood; my eyes seem to penetrate the cloudy midnight of time, and to discern within the depths of its darkness, the fruition of all my soul desires .
my tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment .
the mounting flames had curled round the building, as it fell, and was destroyed .
besides, they observed that it appeared that i had brought the body from another place, and it was likely that as i did not appear to know the shore, i might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of from the place where i had deposited the corpse .
now pause during my journey i might dream, and with buoyant wings reach the summit of life 's high edifice .
he, '' he continued, pointing to the corpse,  ''he suffered not in the consummation of the deed .
it was not so with me; and the question of rank and right dwindled to insignificance in my eyes, when i pictured the scene of suffering athens .
when their course is fulfilled, the dial begins to cast westward an uncertain shadow; the eye lids of day are opened, and birds and flowers, the startled vegetation, and fresh breeze awaken; the sun at length appears, and in majestic procession climbs the capitol of heaven .
nature, our mother, and our friend, had turned on us a brow of menace .
strange system riddle of the sphynx, most awe striking that thus man remains, while we the individuals pass away .
plague might not revive with the summer; but if it did, it should find us prepared .
 ''do not think that i would intrude upon your confidence: i only ask your patience .
let him bare his arm and transfix me with lightning this is also one of his attributes '' and the old man laughed .
they seldom addressed each other, shunning explanation, each fearing any communication the other might make .
he rose and quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it .
when the latter died this sister was taken by her maternal relations: they had seldom seen one another, and were quite unlike in disposition .
chapter my present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost .
he gave me an illustrious name and noble station; the world 's respect reflected from his own glory: all this joined to his own undying love, inspired me with sensations towards him, akin to those with which we regard the giver of life .
he had sinned against his own honour, by affirming, swearing to, a direct falsehood; true this he had palmed on a woman, and it might therefore be deemed less base by others not by him; for whom had he deceived?
sights of woe now became familiar to me, and were i to tell all of anguish and pain that i witnessed, of the despairing moans of age, and the more terrible smiles of infancy in the bosom of horror, my reader, his limbs quivering and his hair on end, would wonder how i did not, seized with sudden frenzy, dash myself from some precipice, and so close my eyes for ever on the sad end of the world .
methinks his spirit remains here as well as that dust, which, uncommunicable though it be, is more precious in its nothingness than aught else widowed earth clasps to her sorrowing bosom .
surely the glorious twins of latona were not more welcome, when, in the infancy of the world, they were brought forth to beautify and enlighten this  ''sterile promontory, '' than were this angelic pair to my lowly dwelling and grateful heart .
where could we turn, and not find a desolation pregnant with the dire lesson of example?
as the country people poured into london, the citizens fled southwards they climbed the higher edifices of the town, fancying that they could discern the smoke and flames the enemy spread around them .
her internal pride and humility of manner were now more than ever at war .
from my youth i have said, i will be virtuous; i will dedicate my life for the good of others; i will do my best to extirpate evil and if the spirit who protects ill should so influence circumstances that i should suffer through my endeavour, yet while there is hope and hope there ever must be, of success, cheerfully do i gird myself to my task .
she endeavoured to read his thought, and then answered with dignity,  ''as you please .
a moment more and the old walls again met my sight, while over them hovered a murky cloud; fragments of buildings whirled above, half seen in smoke, while flames burst out beneath, and continued explosions filled the air with terrific thunders .
they spurn and hate me .
frankness and social feelings were the essence of raymond 's nature; without them his qualities became common place; without these to spread glory over his intercourse with perdita, his vaunted exchange of a throne for her love, was as weak and empty as the rainbow hues which vanish when the sun is down .
he paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion .
in those days the rest of the world was nothing to me: all other men i never considered nor felt what they were; nor did i look on you as one of them .
perhaps a history such as mine had better die with me, but a feeling that i cannot define leads me on and i am too weak both in body and mind to resist the slightest impulse .
raymond could not resist these signs of distress: he felt perhaps somewhat ashamed of the part he acted of the injured man, he who was in truth the injurer .
as for instance, a typhus fever has been brought by ships to one sea port town; yet the very people who brought it there, were incapable of communicating it in a town more fortunately situated .
it was a melancholy pleasure to me to listen to his inspired words; to catch for a moment the light of his eyes; to feel a transient sympathy and then to awaken from the delusion, again to know that all this was nothing, a dream a shadow for that there was no reallity for me; my father had for ever deserted me, leaving me only memories which set an eternal barrier between me and my fellow creatures .
she answered my reasonings more briefly, declaring with disdain, that the reason was hers; and, until i could persuade her that the past could be unacted, that maturity could go back to the cradle, and that all that was could become as though it had never been, it was useless to assure her that no real change had taken place in her fate .
he was sent to cumberland; but the plan of correspondence between the lovers, arranged by evadne, was effectually hidden from her .
yet, as he had lived on for months nearly in the same state, he did not inspire us with any immediate fear; and, though he talked of death as an event most familiar to his thoughts, he did not cease to exert himself to render others happy, or to cultivate his own astonishing powers of mind .
we met baggage waggons, and many females of high and low rank returning to fairy or kishan, there to wait the issue of the expected day .
the flames of the city bent beneath it; and the smoke and dust arising from the ruins was dissipated .
every night i was oppressed by a slow fever, and i became nervous to a most painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and i shunned my fellow creatures as if i had been guilty of a crime .
but do you not see, that, under the idea of exalting me, he is chalking out a new path for himself; a path of action from which he has long wandered?
all slept all england slept; and from my window, commanding a wide prospect of the star illumined country, i saw the land stretched out in placid rest .
shall i disturb this calm by mingling in the world?
shall the daughter of the noble, though prodigal zaimi, appear a beggar before her compeers or inferiors superiors she had none .
 ''perdita, '' i had said,  ''some day you will discover that you have done wrong in again casting raymond on the thorns of life .
morning dawned before i arrived at the village of chamounix; i took no rest, but returned immediately to geneva .
i had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother, and i eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion .
this undercurrent of thought, often soothed me amidst distress, and even agony .
the labour necessary to bring the lands to this sort of culture, employed and fed the offcasts of the diminished manufactories .
he died embracing the sod, which was piled above his breast, when he was placed beside the beings whom he regretted with such wild despair .
sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, i failed; yet still i clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realize .
i sometimes expostulated with perdita on the subject of her reserve; but she rejected my counsels, while her daughter 's sensibility excited in her a tenderness still more passionate .
it was my task each day to visit the various families assembled in our town, and when the weather permitted, i was glad to prolong my ride, and to muse in solitude over every changeful appearance of our destiny, endeavouring to gather lessons for the future from the experience of the past .
such was the depth of my emotion that i had no feeling of what caused my distress, my thoughts even wandered to many indifferent objects; but still neither moving limb or feature my tears fell untill, as if the fountains were exhausted, they gradually subsided, and i awoke to life as from a dream .
o ye heart strings of mine, could ye be torn asunder, and my soul not spend itself in tears of blood for sorrow idris, after the first shock, regained a portion of fortitude .
little clara accompanied us; the poor child did not well understand what was going forward .
with new courage, therefore, i pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore .
she went on, feeling that, if she had paused for a moment, the checked waters of misery would have deluged her soul, that her wrecked hopes would raise their wailing voices, and that those who now echoed her mirth, and provoked her repartees, would have shrunk in fear from her convulsive despair .
he promised that he would come and see me again; and bade me take cheer, and to encourage what happy thoughts i could, untill time and fortitude should overcome my misery, and i could again mingle in society .
your heart i fear, replied diotima, was broken by your sufferings but if you had struggled if when you found all hope of earthly happiness wither within you while desire of it scorched your soul if you had near you a friend to have raised you to the contemplation of beauty the search of knowledge you would have found perhaps not new hopes spring within you but a new life distinct from that of passion by which you had before existed relate to me what this misery was that thus engroses you tell me what were the vicissitudes of feeling that you endured on earth after death our actions worldly interest fade as nothing before us but the traces of our feelings exist the memories of those are what furnish us here with eternal subject of meditation .
some, in the true spirit of reckless enterprise, went on board a ship of an hundred and twenty guns; the vast hull drifted with the tide out of the bay, and after many hours its crew of landsmen contrived to spread a great part of her enormous canvass the wind took it, and while a thousand mistakes of the helmsman made her present her head now to one point, and now to another, the vast fields of canvass that formed her sails flapped with a sound like that of a huge cataract; or such as a sea like forest may give forth when buffeted by an equinoctial north wind .
but i wander from my relation let woe come at its appointed time; i may at this stage of my story still talk of happiness .
i proposed the enterprize of poaching on his demesne to my few remaining comrades, who were the most determined and lawless of the crew; but they all shrunk from the peril; so i was left to achieve my revenge myself .
stopping short, i clasped my hands, and with the fervour of a new proselyte, cried,  ''doubt me not, adrian, i also will become wise and good '' and then quite overcome, i wept aloud .
the images of health and hope which i presented to her, made her with a smile consent .
the light became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as i walked, i sought a place where i could receive shade .
the picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket; and when elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court .
so i was entirely thrown upon my own resourses .
there is nothing more lovely, to which the heart more yearns than a free spirited boy, gentle, brave, and generous .
as yet, thank god, i am equal to the government of the town; and i look only to the present .
he died soon after, leaving two children, a son and a daughter .
could i be other than all ear, to one who seemed to govern the whole earth in his grasping imagination, and who only quailed when he attempted to rule himself .
even perdita will rejoice .
she hung over the patient in agony, which was not mitigated when her thoughts wandered towards her babes, for whom she feared infection .
he spoke with pride; he felt injured .
to england, therefore, i was bound, and it was understood that my union with elizabeth should take place immediately on my return .
then i would hasten to my desk, weave the new found web of mind in firm texture and brilliant colours, leaving the fashioning of the material to a calmer moment .
i owe you six years of unalloyed happiness .
he is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence .
it is midnight; the breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir .
raymond started angrily when he saw me .
on the twenty first of june, it was said that an hour before noon, a black sun arose: an orb, the size of that luminary, but dark, defined, whose beams were shadows, ascended from the west; in about an hour it had reached the meridian, and eclipsed the bright parent of day .
the rage and yells of the wounded man, the howling execrations of his comrade, which i answered with equal bitterness and fury, echoed through the dell; morning broke more and more, ill accordant in its celestial beauty with our brute and noisy contest .
i am alone and miserable; man will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me .
the woods around afforded us shade, the river secured to us a constant supply of water; nay, detachments were employed in furnishing the army with ice, which had been laid up on haemus, and athos, and the mountains of macedonia, while cooling fruits and wholesome food renovated the strength of the labourers, and made us bear with less impatience the weight of the unrefreshing air .
 ''the day is ours, '' he cried,  ''the turks fly from the bayonet . ''
there was but one good and one evil in the world life and death .
i passed from the palace of sweet waters to the plain on which the encampment lay, and found its inhabitants in commotion .
this idea made me shudder and recalled me to action .
the plague i am told is in constantinople, perhaps i have imbibed its effluvia perhaps disease is the real cause of my prognostications .
the nobles did not hesitate to express their fear; the other party endeavoured to treat the matter lightly .
i lived far from the busy haunts of men, and the rumour of wars or political changes came worn to a mere sound, to our mountain abodes .
 ''the family, after having been thus occupied for a short time, extinguished their lights and retired, as i conjectured, to rest . ''
it was in the latter end of september that i again quitted my native country .
 ''as to the likelihood of escaping, '' said adrian,  ''ten years hence the cold stars may shine on the graves of all of us; but as to my peculiar liability to infection, i could easily prove, both logically and physically, that in the midst of contagion i have a better chance of life than you .
no father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as i should deserve theirs .
first he was to visit evadne, and then to hasten to the palace of the protectorate .
 ''felix conducted the fugitives through france to lyons and across mont cenis to leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the turkish dominions .
but they were awed as i had been, at the change of his appearance .
it keeps up a perpetual fever in my veins; it frets my immedicable wound; it is instinct with poison .
i repeat his persuasions in faint terms and cannot give you at the same time the tone and gesture that animated them .
the earth was spread out as an highway for him; the heavens built up as a canopy for him .
 ''i had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers their grace, beauty, and delicate complexions; but how was i terrified when i viewed myself in a transparent pool at first i started back, unable to believe that it was indeed i who was reflected in the mirror; and when i became fully convinced that i was in reality the monster that i am, i was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification .
i wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair .
i go with the belief that i have your pardon .
a mightier power than the human was at hand to destroy our plans or to achieve the work we avoided .
this contention is unworthy of both of us; and i confess that i am weary of replying to charges at once unfounded and unkind . ''
  ''my dear victor, '' cried he,  ''what, for god's sake, is the matter?
why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove yourselves cowards .
and do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?
children, unadepts in language, seldom find words to express their thoughts, nor could we tell in what manner the late events had impressed themselves on her mind .
even our soldiers were awed to silence; the music paused; the clang of arms was hushed .
 ''my dear victor, do not speak thus .
they were certainly independant for neither could the good spirit allow the existence of evil or the evil one the existence of good tired of these doubts to which i could form no probable solution sick of forming theories which i destroyed as quickly as i built them i was one evening on the top of hymettus beholding the lovely prospect as the sun set in the glowing sea i looked towards athens in my heart i exclaimed oh busy hive of men what heroism what meaness exists within thy walls and alas both to the good to the wicked what incalculable misery freemen ye call yourselves yet every free man has ten slaves to build up his freedom and these slaves are men as they are yet degraded by their station to all that is mean loathsome yet in how many hearts now beating in that city do high thoughts live magnanimity that should methinks redeem the whole human race what though the good man is unhappy has he not that in his heart to satisfy him?
i accompanied the whale fishers on several expeditions to the north sea; i voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; i often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage .
begone, or let us try our strength in a fight, in which one must fall . ''
i escaped from them to the room where lay the body of elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy .
 ''i am now going to undertake an office fitted for me .
when they found themselves discovered they discharged their muskets, and some came to the front to cover the others, whose crews, exerting all their strength, endeavoured to escape with their light barks from among the dark hulls that environed them .
the fate of the world seemed bound up in the death of this single man .
i turned from the awful ruin of the golden city, and, after great exertion, succeeded in extricating myself from its enclosure .
i know it i see it you hate me '' i was transported by violent emotion, and rising from his feet, at which i had thrown myself, i leant against a tree, wildly raising my eyes to heaven .
she played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger .
do not be long away '' i assured her of my impatience to return, and then, with a small escort rode along the plain towards the tower of marmora .
these disasters came home to so many bosoms, and, through the various channels of commerce, were carried so entirely into every class and division of the community, that of necessity they became the first question in the state, the chief subjects to which we must turn our attention .
we endeavoured to calm him but our own hearts were not calm .
adrian had the superiority in learning and eloquence; but raymond possessed a quick penetration, and a practical knowledge of life, which usually displayed itself in opposition to adrian, and thus kept up the ball of discussion .
she herself would disdain my interference .
from the many peopled earth, from the sympathies of man, from the loved resorts of my youth, from the kindness of my friends, from the affection of my only beloved perdita, i am about to be removed .
the kind of banishment he now experienced arose from other causes .
they studied, they rode together; they were never seperate and seldom admitted a third to their society .
a heavy rain made this mode of travelling now incommodious; so we embarked in a steam packet, and after a short passage landed at portsmouth .
i gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage .
remember, that i love her still, that my dearest hope is that she will again be mine .
there are times when we have an indefinable sentiment of impending change for better or for worse, to arise from an event; and, be it for better or for worse, we fear the change, and shun the event .
but certainly she had made deep observations while she noted in silence the changes that passed around her .
it was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below .
the injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all paris was indignant; and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation .
can the calm beams of their heaven seeking eyes equal the flashes of mingling passion which blind his, or does the influence of cold philosophy steep their soul in a joy equal to his, engaged in this dear work of youthful revelry .
 ''why, my little lady protectress, '' said he, playfully,  ''what is this you say?
although by our situation and dispositions we were almost equally cut off from the usual forms of social intercourse, we formed a strong contrast to each other .
although i possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour .
party speeches were delivered, which clothed the question in cant, and veiled its simple meaning in a woven wind of words .
i saw at this juncture that raymond changed colour; his eyes were withdrawn from the orator, and cast on the ground; the listeners turned from one to the other; but in the meantime the speaker 's voice filled their ears the thunder of his denunciations influenced their senses .
i confess, that i have not been unmoved by the development of the tale; and that i have been depressed, nay, agonized, at some parts of the recital, which i have faithfully transcribed from my materials .
idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that i wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, i felt great relief in being the fellow pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists .
alfred, now nine years old, was an upright, manly little fellow, with radiant brow, soft eyes, and gentle, though independent disposition .
why am i obliged to live?
i was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion .
come, as you have played despair with me i will play the part of una with you and bring you hurtless from his dark cavern .
my departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred an omen, as it were, of my future misery .
on the fourth morning all vanished .
i was from a thousand motives induced to attend minutely to the course of events, and watch each turn with intense anxiety .
half frightened, i would have taken her hand; but she shudderingly withdrew it, and strove to collect herself .
his blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved .
i found that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which i had embarked .
she saw my despondency, and the aching cares of idris .
i arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking .
then, with lids humid with a tear and trembling voice, she continued  ''dear friends, do not think it strange that now, visiting you for the first time, i ask your assistance, and confide my wishes and fears to you .
these contemplations engaged her, when the voice of raymond first struck her ear, a voice, once heard, never to be forgotten; she mastered her gush of feelings, and welcomed him with quiet gentleness .
instances of desertion became more frequent; and even murders, which made the hearer sick with horror, where the fear of contagion had armed those nearest in blood against each other .
i even now blush at the falsehoods i uttered; my heart sickens: i will leave this complication of what i hope i may in a manner call innocent deceit to be imagined by the reader .
i carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which i at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory .
more than once the agitation into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse .
 ''indeed i dare not die .
the sensation is most dreary, to use no stronger term, with which one looks forward to passing the long hours of night beside a sick bed, especially if the patient be an infant, who cannot explain its pain, and whose flickering life resembles the wasting flame of the watch light, whose narrow fire is shaken by the wind, and on whose edge devouring darkness hovers .
on the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country .
alas why must i record the hapless delusion of this matchless specimen of humanity?
you are younger; yet i do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed .
when i am gone, you will console your mother, and tell her that death was only bitter because it divided me from her; that my last thoughts will be spent on her .
some years ago, when the images which this world affords first opened upon me, when i felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to me, i should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation .
in a few moments i saw him in his boat, which shot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves .
all went on cheerfully now; we met as usual, and talked without dread of our future plans .
during the first year of their marriage, perdita presented raymond with a lovely girl .
this also was my doing and my father 's woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of my thrice accursed hands ye weep, unhappy ones, but these are not your last tears again shall you raise the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving you he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair, i beheld those i loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of william and justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts .
the trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the charge, several witnesses were called .
that he should be restless i understood; that he should wander as an unlaid ghost and find no quiet from the burning hell that consumed his heart .
to escape these evils was the aim and scope of all our exertions .
the political state of england became agitated as the time drew near when the new protector was to be elected .
i dared not think that the sun should shine and the moon rise not on your living form but on your grave .
whatever those might be which descended to me, my noble young friend resolved should not be lost for want of culture .
you promised to facilitate my visit to adrian; i conjure you to perform your promise .
but i enjoyed friends, dear not only through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever i am, the soothing voice of my elizabeth and the conversation of clerval will be ever whispered in my ear .
i was alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries .
o quickly bind up the wounds of the fallen let not one die; let not one more soul escape through your merciless gashes, to relate before the throne of god the tale of fratricide; bind up their wounds restore them to their friends .
in the same spirit of exaggeration she had, on the event of her separation from raymond, caused it to be entirely neglected .
a shriek burst from the lips of the poor wretch; and then sudden motionlessness came over him; it was manifest to all that he was dead .
she felt, that, once awakened, raymond would never return unrepining to windsor .
for a time, i thought that, by watching a complying moment, fostering the still warm ashes, i might relume in her the flame of love .
i did not dare return to the apartment which i inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky .
never was she so enchanting as at this time, when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us .
he entered while we were speaking .
his appearance re animated our friend; and, when he came to speak and act, his hesitation vanished, and he shone out supreme in majesty and victory .
it was curious to trace in this miniature model the very traits of its father .
oh my pen haste thou to write what was, before the thought of what is, arrests the hand that guides thee .
notwithstanding the melancholy object of my journey, my spirits were exhilarated by reviving hope, by the swift motion of the airy pinnace, and the balmy visitation of the sunny air .
but, by the god that made me, hell is not more false than the word you have spoken '' perdita was struck by the impassioned seriousness of his asseverations .
interpret my words with candour and answer me, i conjure you, with confidence and sincerity . ''
love is a delicate sprite and easily hurt by rough jealousy .
resolved to pursue no inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the east, as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise .
raymond recognized her; and his manner changed from polite beneficence to the warmest protestations of kindness and sympathy .
the high born ladies of the country would have deemed themselves disgraced if they had now enjoyed, what they before called a necessary, the ease of a carriage .
it was curious that even little clara observed this law towards her mother .
thus in her twenty ninth year she died; having enjoyed some few years of the happiness of paradise, and sustaining a reverse to which her impatient spirit and affectionate disposition were unable to submit .
remember, thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my joints more supple .
i did not participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful .
sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish .
enjoyment plays the cook to their homely fare, and mingles intoxication with their simple drink .
clara was dear to her, to all .
the mutual link of our destinies is broken; we must be divided by seas by land .
let me try if he will die with me; and as i fear to die alone, if he will accompany me to cheer me, and thus he can shew himself my friend in the only manner my misery will permit .
finding the door open, i entered .
then weeping, she clung to me:  ''take me to him, '' she cried,  ''unkind lionel, why do you keep me here?
the arts of life, and the discoveries of science had augmented in a ratio which left all calculation behind; food sprung up, so to say, spontaneously machines existed to supply with facility every want of the population .
below this picture was a miniature of william; and my tears flowed when i looked upon it .
as i spoke i fixed my eyes upon his countenance, and his exquisite beauty, the heavenly compassion that beamed from his eyes, his gentle yet earnest look of deprecation and wonder even before he spoke wrought a change in my high strained feelings taking from me all the sterness of despair and filling me only with the softest grief .
their landing was long unknown, but having now advanced within an hundred miles of london, the country people flying before them arrived in successive troops, each exaggerating the numbers, fury, and cruelty of the assailants .
in the face of all this we call ourselves lords of the creation, wielders of the elements, masters of life and death, and we allege in excuse of this arrogance, that though the individual is destroyed, man continues for ever .
i appeal to moralists and sages .
i perceived, as the shape came nearer sight tremendous and abhorred that it was the wretch whom i had created .
such is, to borrow the words of an eloquent and philosophic writer,  ''the mode of existence decreed to a permanent body composed of transitory parts; wherein, by the disposition of a stupendous wisdom, moulding together the great mysterious incorporation of the human race, the whole, at one time, is never old, or middle aged, or young, but, in a condition of unchangeable constancy, moves on through the varied tenour of perpetual decay, fall, renovation, and progression . ''
others will toss these pages lightly over: to you, woodville, kind, affectionate friend, they will be dear the precious memorials of a heart broken girl who, dying, is still warmed by gratitude towards you: your tears will fall on the words that record my misfortunes; i know they will and while i have life i thank you for your sympathy .
a mirror betrayed the sign to idris she started up .
but the intermediate steps, the climbing the wall, raised up between what was and is, while i still looked back nor saw the concealed desert beyond, is a labour past my strength .
 ''come, '' said adrian,  ''i have promised for you, enable me to keep my engagement .
 ''i ask but one thing; i do not fear his hell, for i have it here; i do not desire his heaven, let me but die and be laid beside them; let me but, when i lie dead, feel my flesh as it moulders, mingle with theirs .
i stood watching the scene, while adrian flitted like a shadow in among them, and, by a word and look of sobriety, endeavoured to restore order in the assembly .
he came, therefore, sometimes to see that i was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long intervals .
oh no mortal could support the horror of that countenance .
when such a thought was heedlessly uttered, the hearers, with a gush of tears and passionate sobs, bore witness how deep their fears were, how small their hopes .
i do not know how long i remained in this situation, but when i awoke i found that the sun had already mounted considerably .
who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me?
mingled with this horror, i felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, which indicated the sixth hour .
thus i promised myself, as i journied towards my destination with roused and ardent expectation: expectation of the fulfilment of all that in boyhood we promise ourselves of power and enjoyment in maturity .
i had scarcely uttered these words than a flash instantly followed by a tremendous peal of thunder descended on it; and when my eyes recovered their sight after the dazzling light, the oak no longer stood in the meadow the old man uttered a wild exclamation of horror when he saw so sudden an interpretation given to my prophesy .
yet the purpose of his soul, his energy and ardent resolution, prevented any re action of sorrow .
she fancied that raymond would already be free, and that her tender attentions would come to entirely obliterate even the memory of his mischance .
but he is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him .
perdita 's name was not mentioned; yet i could not doubt that love for her caused the vacillation of purpose that he exhibited .
my father had expressed a wish in his letters that she should reside with me at his family mansion which was situated in a beautiful country near richmond in yorkshire .
it was not joy only that possessed me; i felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly .
it seems to me a wild adventure to find in this desart one like you quite solitary: you are young and lovely; your manners are refined and attractive; yet there is in your settled melancholy, and something, i know not what, in your expressive eyes that seems to seperate you from your kind: you shudder; pardon me, i entreat you but i cannot help expressing this once at least the lively interest i feel in your destiny .
 ''alas, for us, '' i cried,  ''who have lost this latest honour of the world beloved raymond he is gone to the nations of the dead; he has become one of those, who render the dark abode of the obscure grave illustrious by dwelling there .
i will not speak be it enough for you to know that i am miserable be it enough for you to know, that the painted veil of life is rent, that i sit for ever shrouded in darkness and gloom, that grief is my sister, everlasting lamentation my mate '' i endeavoured to console her; i did not question her but i caressed her, assured her of my deepest affection and my intense interest in the changes of her fortune:  ''dear words, '' she cried,  ''expressions of love come upon my ear, like the remembered sounds of forgotten music, that had been dear to me .
a few days before we left paris on our way to switzerland, i received the following letter from elizabeth:  ''my dear friend,  ''it gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and i may hope to see you in less than a fortnight .
i abhorred the face of man .
frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness .
i no sooner perceived an abatement of the flames than, hurried on by an irresistible impulse, i endeavoured to penetrate the town .
i am quite weary of enduring the misery which hourly i do endure, and i will throw it off .
he left me but i still was calm, and after i had saluted the starry sky and dewy earth with eyes of love and a contented good night, i slept sweetly, visited by dreams, the first of pleasure i had had for many long months .
and day like a thin exhalation melt away both wrapping up their beams in clouds to be themselves close mourners at this obsequie .
a residence in turkey was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it .
since then, the influence of the landed proprietors had augmented; and at first ryland was not sorry to observe the machinations of lord raymond, which drew off many of his opponent 's partizans .
 ''take care of yourself, my dear lord, '' i said .
the blue eyes of my angelic girl were fixed on this sweet emblem of herself:   ''how the light palpitates, '' she said,  ''which is that star's life .
my arrival was like the newly discovered lamp of a lighthouse to sailors, who are weathering some dangerous point .
idris could not endure to leave him in this state; nor was it right either to quit or take with us a young family for a journey of this description .
i have often thought of offering my services to the pestilence stricken towns of france and italy; but fear of paining you, and expectation of this catastrophe, withheld me .
and then in a moment he said,  ''no, that must not be; you must not read dante .
we have watched over her; nursed her flickering existence; now she has fallen at once from youth to decrepitude, from health to immedicinable disease; even as we spend ourselves in struggles for her recovery, she dies; to all nations the voice goes forth, hope is dead we are but mourners in the funeral train, and what immortal essence or perishable creation will refuse to make one in the sad procession that attends to its grave the dead comforter of humanity?
the wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew .
let our affection expire but let it not be exchanged for distrust and recrimination .
his habits were unhinged; his restless mind roused from its sleep, ambition must now be his companion through life; and if he did not succeed in his present attempt, she foresaw that unhappiness and cureless discontent would follow .
do you believe, verney, that i brought you to town for that?
the sound of firing, early on the following morning, informed us that advanced posts of the armies were engaged .
the very difference of our dispositions gave zest to these conversations .
i lived in a desolate country where there were none to praise and very few to love  .a it is true that i now saw a little more of my aunt, but she was in every way an unsocial being; and to a timid child she was as a plant beneath a thick covering of ice; i should cut my hands in endeavouring to get at it.
i felt that this was insanity i sprang forward to throw it off; i rushed into the midst of the crowd .
my garments were torn, and they, as well as my hands, were stained with the blood of the man i had wounded; one hand grasped the dead birds my hard earned prey, the other held the knife; my hair was matted; my face besmeared with the same guilty signs that bore witness against me on the dripping instrument i clenched; my whole appearance was haggard and squalid .
rely, therefore, on your hopes; and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair . '
his vivacity, intelligence, and active spirit of benevolence, completed the conquest .
i lay for two months on the point of death; my ravings, as i afterwards heard, were frightful; i called myself the murderer of william, of justine, and of clerval .
beneath the shades of night, and through the day, whose garish light displays our solitude, thou wilt still be at my side, and even windsor will not be regretted . ''
oh god help me let him be alive it is all dark; in my abject misery i demand no more: no hope, no good: only passion, and guilt, and horror; but alive alive my sensations choked me no tears fell yet i sobbed, and breathed short and hard; one only thought possessed me, and i could only utter one word, that half screaming was perpetually on my lips; alive alive i had taken the steward with me for he, much better than i, could make the requisite enquiries the poor old man could not restrain his tears as he saw my deep distress and knew the cause he sometimes uttered a few broken words of consolation: in moments like these the mistress and servant become in a manner equals and when i saw his old dim eyes wet with sympathizing tears; his gray hair thinly scattered on an age wrinkled brow i thought oh if my father were as he is decrepid hoary then i should be spared this pain when i had arrived at the nearest town i took post horses and followed the road my father had taken .
that it would vanish altogether was an hope too dear too heartfelt, to be expressed .
every one loved him; no shadow of envy or hate cast even from the meanest mind ever fell upon him .
swiftly i thought yes, i will witness the last scene of the drama .
idris stood at a window that over looked the park; her maternal eyes sought her own children among the young crowd .
do not again speak to me in this strain; but wait in submissive patience the event of what is passing around you  . ''  ''oh, yes '' i passionately replied,  ''i will be very patient; i will not be rash or presumptuous: i will see the agonies, and tears, and despair of my father, my only friend, my hope, my shelter, i will see it all with folded arms and downcast eyes.
felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his arabian .
those who modestly betook themselves to the smaller craft, for the most part achieved their watery journey in safety .
 ''do you, '' said i,  ''enjoy yourself, and let this be our rendezvous .
they are vain, i know; how very vain in their attempt to soothe or comfort me .
the magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness .
in a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees .
one by one they left her at length she pressed the hand of her last visitor .
i entreated adrian to return to me after he had conducted his sister home .
i learned from your papers that you were my father, my creator; and to whom could i apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life?
my first thought was to discover what i knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made .
explanation you may possibly say, what can elizabeth have to explain?
man you may hate, but beware your hours will pass in dread and misery, and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness forever .
my future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union . ''
the sight of it soothed her .
i took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman .
the idea was terrible to my half crazed imagination, and almost over turned the little self possession that still remained to me .
all this i endeavoured to veil, so that it might least impress my idris; yet, as i have said, my courage survived even despair: i might be vanquished, but i would not yield .
as i was in a state of extreme debility, i resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place where i could most easily procure nourishment .
i persuaded idris to go up to london, where she might better attend to necessary arrangements .
his wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart .
 ''little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken place since you left us .
in two years, i should return to my country, with a name well known and a reputation already founded .
we were for ever together; and the subjects of our conversations were inexhaustible .
the birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees .
they made many signs which i did not comprehend, but i saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists .
concerning the picture she could give no account .
and the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom i had not seen for so long a time .
before dawn i led my flock to the sheep walks, and guarded them through the day .
so shall it not be did not alexander leap from the walls of the city of the oxydracae, to shew his coward troops the way to victory, encountering alone the swords of its defenders?
in these last moments i feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness .
we marked the difference of character among the boys, and endeavoured to read the future man in the stripling .
august th, my affection for my guest increases every day .
 ''he was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to elizabeth .
but you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any kind . ''
i found that i could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition .
thus i felt, when disappointment, weariness, and solitude drove me back upon my heart, to gather thence the joy of which it had become barren .
the little bark to which i had beckoned had now pulled up; before i could stop her, perdita, assisted by the sailors was in it clara followed her mother a loud shout echoed from the crowd as we pulled out of the inner harbour; while my sister at the prow, had caught hold of one of the men who was using a glass, asking a thousand questions, careless of the spray that broke over her, deaf, sightless to all, except the little speck that, just visible on the top of the waves, evidently neared .
the very memory half unmans me .
he became cheerful, as he thought of this, and soberly and resolutely marked out the line of conduct he would adopt .
almost fainting i slowly approached the fatal waters; when we had quitted the town we heard their roaring .
she resided at the palace of sweet waters, a summer seraglio of the sultan; the beauty of the surrounding scenery, undefiled by war, and the freshness of the river, made this spot doubly delightful .
the story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream, and i have no motive for falsehood . ''
a more intense feeling of the reality of fiction possessed raymond .
it was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation .
he has journied on the road that leads to it, and joined the mighty of soul who went before him .
weak spirited women died of fear as they listened to their denunciations; men of robust form and seeming strength fell into idiotcy and madness, racked by the dread of coming eternity .
when she saw who it was, she approached me and said,  ''dear sir, you are very kind to visit me; you, i hope, do not believe that i am guilty? ''
i am malicious because i am miserable .
two days after we came to our determination, we set out for portsmouth, and embarked .
i rode one morning with raymond to the lofty mound, not far from the top kapou, cannon gate, on which mahmoud planted his standard, and first saw the city .
you dare not keep me  .   '  '''frankenstein you belong then to my enemy to him towards whom i have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.'
her delicate organization and creative imagination rendered her peculiarly susceptible of pleasurable emotion .
i wait but for one event, and then i shall repose in peace .
i shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer .
after he had been employed thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together .
i sometimes strove to form friendships with the most attractive of the girls who inhabited the neighbouring village; but i believe i should never have succeeded even had not my aunt interposed her authority to prevent all intercourse between me and the peasantry; for she was fearful lest i should acquire the scotch accent and dialect; a little of it i had, although great pains was taken that my tongue should not disgrace my english origin .
i am just come from him .
raymond was weak and exhausted, yet the interest he perceived to be excited on his account, filled him with proud pleasure .
farewell, walton seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries .
there was too deep a horror in my tale for confidence; i was on earth the sole depository of my own secret .
in another fortnight i was able to leave my chamber .
we shall not then be degraded from our true characters .
hope only supported me, the hope that i should not be too late .
i do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit .
to this life, miserable father, i devote thee go be thy days passed with savages, and thy nights under the cope of heaven be thy limbs worn and thy heart chilled, and all youth be dead within thee let thy hairs be as snow; thy walk trembling and thy voice have lost its mellow tones let the liquid lustre of thine eyes be quenched; and then return to me, return to thy mathilda, thy child, who may then be clasped in thy loved arms, while thy heart beats with sinless emotion .
let me not forget my chiefest errand here .
a practised ear might trace an undue faltering in the step of the soldiers; but this was not occasioned so much by fear of the adversary, as by disease, by sorrow, and by fatal prognostications, which often weighed most potently on the brave, and quelled the manly heart to abject subjection .
 ''where? ''  ''every where we must fly all fly but whither?

go you before break of day, bear these dispatches to karazza, add to them your own entreaties that he send me his marines and naval force; if i can get but one regiment to second me, the rest would follow of course .
during the five years we had spent together, a knot of happy human beings at windsor castle, her blissful lot had been the frequent theme of my sister 's conversation .
the next step was to induce raymond to confess his secret wishes for dignity and fame .
i could not fail to perceive this change .
they, the good, the wise, and the beloved, are gone before .
begone i have answered you; you may torture me, but i will never consent . ''
my first visit would be to my sister, who inhabited a little cottage, a part of adrian 's gift, on the borders of windsor forest .
i cannot follow; for i do not sympathize in their dreams of massacre and glory to follow and to lead in such a career, is the natural bent of raymond 's mind .
winter passed away; and spring, led by the months, awakened life in all nature .
 ''be assured, sir, '' said he,  ''no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain . ''
you will not follow me, for when i bannish myself would you nourish guilt by obtruding yourself upon me?
to me he discoursed ceaselessly of his beloved ionian .
she moved again, and i fled .
i resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate .
i walked with a quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college .
the forms of the beloved dead flit before me, and i hasten to their arms .
the sea was gently agitated, now shewing a white crest, and now resuming an uniform hue; the clouds had disappeared; and dark ether clipt the broad ocean, in which the constellations vainly sought their accustomed mirror .
it advanced from behind the mountains of jura, and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens .
no; shed a few natural tears due to my memory: and if you ever visit my grave, pluck from thence a flower, and lay it to your heart; for your heart is the only tomb in which my memory will be enterred .
the fibres of his frame became relaxed, and cold dew stood on his forehead, at this idea .
after his motion had been seconded, lord raymond rose, his countenance bland, his voice softly melodious, his manner soothing, his grace and sweetness came like the mild breathing of a flute, after the loud, organ like voice of his adversary .
in the morning the custom house officers, together with a crowd of idlers, visited her .
if idris became thin and pale, it was anxiety that occasioned the change; an anxiety i could in no way alleviate .
their numbers ably arranged; the very deaths among them concealed; moving on in good order, and apparently given up to enjoyment, they excited the envy of the irish .
but still do i flatter myself that this would have passed away .
she obtained an hearing, he sat in haughty silence, but he listened .
the tears and agitation of my poor sister had rendered her unfit to return to the circle we had left so i persuaded her to let me drive her through the park; and, during the ride, i induced her to confide the tale of her unhappiness to me, fancying that talking of it would lighten the burthen, and certain that, if there were a remedy, it should be found and secured to her .
i would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the andes, could i when there have precipitated him to their base .
i have often attributed my attachment to, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets .
in doing this, i underwent a kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained .
does not lord bacon say that,   'the falling from a discord to a concord, which maketh great sweetness in music, hath an agreement with the affections, which are re integrated to the better after some dislikes?'
that heart sinking feeling was painted in her sunk eyes and spiritless attitude; a cloud was on her beauty, and frequent sighs were tokens of her distress .
the experience of immemorial time had taught us formerly to count our enjoyments by years, and extend our prospect of life through a lengthened period of progression and decay; the long road threaded a vast labyrinth, and the valley of the shadow of death, in which it terminated, was hid by intervening objects .
as i approached the latter, she seized my hand, and drew me into another apartment; she threw herself into my arms, and wept and sobbed bitterly and long .
he seemed insensible to the presence of any one else, but if, as a trial to awaken his sensibility, my aunt brought me into the room he would instantly rush out with every symptom of fury and distraction .
once i falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which i was capable of unfolding .
but the feelings that actuated evadne were rooted in the depths of her being, and were such in their growth as he had no means of understanding .
but my chief delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted me, i turned with more attention towards the cottagers .
but it is your happiness i desire as well as my own when i declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice .
i had heard of some discoveries having been made by an english philosopher, the knowledge of which was material to my success, and i sometimes thought of obtaining my father 's consent to visit england for this purpose; but i clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me .
thus coming nearer and nearer each other, the howls and shouts of the irish increased; the english proceeded in obedience to their officers, until they came near enough to distinguish the faces of their enemies; the sight inspired them with fury: with one cry, that rent heaven and was re echoed by the furthest lines, they rushed on; they disdained the use of the bullet, but with fixed bayonet dashed among the opposing foe, while the ranks opening at intervals, the matchmen lighted the cannon, whose deafening roar and blinding smoke filled up the horror of the scene .
of one only fault he might have been accused; but his death has cancelled that .
i heard of the discovery of the american hemisphere and wept with safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants .
 ''and do you also believe that i am so very, very wicked?
one clenched hand contained a slip of paper, on which was written,  ''to athens . ''
our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves .
having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness .
at length the king was brought to see in him a source of perpetual disquiet, knowing that he should pay for the short lived pleasure of his society by tedious homilies, and more painful narrations of excesses, the truth of which he could not disprove .
where was pain and evil?
remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again .
her subsequent conduct did not diminish this interest .
 ''certainly, '' replied the ex queen, with bitter scorn,  ''his love, and her love, and both their childish flutterings, are to be put in fit comparison with my years of hope and anxiety, with the duties of the offspring of kings, with the high and dignified conduct which one of her descent ought to pursue .
he also gave me the list of books which i had requested, and i took my leave .
time had altered her since i last beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years .
the first sight of this place for a time unhinged her .
i replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole .
 ''a few months ago, '' he continued,  ''i was thought to be dying; but life was strong within me .
 ''i discovered also another means through which i was enabled to assist their labours .
she never for a moment lost sight of her children .
the fields had been left uncultivated, weeds and gaudy flowers sprung up, or where a few wheat fields shewed signs of the living hopes of the husbandman, the work had been left halfway, the ploughman had died beside the plough; the horses had deserted the furrow, and no seedsman had approached the dead; the cattle unattended wandered over the fields and through the lanes; the tame inhabitants of the poultry yard, baulked of their daily food, had become wild young lambs were dropt in flower gardens, and the cow stalled in the hall of pleasure .
she would sit apart from us and watch him; she would weep for joy to think that he was hers .
it may easily be imagined that i wearied myself with conjecture to guess the cause of his sorrow .
i might tell it to the winds and to the desart heaths but i must never among my fellow creatures, either by word or look give allowance to the smallest conjecture of the dread reality: i must shrink before the eye of man lest he should read my father 's guilt in my glazed eyes: i must be silent lest my faltering voice should betray unimagined horrors .
it was pleasant to see the haughty raymond and reserved perdita changed through happy love into prattling, playful children, both losing their characteristic dignity in the fulness of mutual contentment .
she did not complain; in her brother 's court she would find, not compensation for their disobedience filial unkindness admitted of none, but such a state of things and mode of life, as might best reconcile her to her fate .
as night came on, her spirits, enlivened by my unexpected concession, regained an almost forgotten vivacity .
they opened each other 's letters, even as, until now, the inmost fold of the heart of each was disclosed to the other .
i feared no man, and loved none .
sometimes woodville talked to me of himself .
i am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature . '
my education was neglected, yet i was passionately fond of reading .
his heart was simple like a child, unstained by arrogance or vanity .
my sister and i were left truly like two fools, who fancied that they had obtained a golden treasure, till daylight shewed it to be lead two silly, luckless flies, who had played in sunbeams and were caught in a spider 's web .
she continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark leaved brambles .
the new elections were finished; parliament met, and raymond was occupied in a thousand beneficial schemes .
i am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every moment to crush my vessel .
it was not in my nature to derive consolation from such scenes; from theatres, whose buffoon laughter and discordant mirth awakened distempered sympathy, or where fictitious tears and wailings mocked the heart felt grief within; from festival or crowded meeting, where hilarity sprung from the worst feelings of our nature, or such enthralment of the better ones, as impressed it with garish and false varnish; from assemblies of mourners in the guise of revellers .
the path to it had been enlarged, and steps hewn in the rock led us less circuitously than before, to the spot itself; the platform on which the pyramid stood was enlarged, and looking towards the south, in a recess overshadowed by the straggling branches of a wild fig tree, i saw foundations dug, and props and rafters fixed, evidently the commencement of a cottage; standing on its unfinished threshold, the tomb was at our right hand, the whole ravine, and plain, and azure sea immediately before us; the dark rocks received a glow from the descending sun, which glanced along the cultivated valley, and dyed in purple and orange the placid waves; we sat on a rocky elevation, and i gazed with rapture on the beauteous panorama of living and changeful colours, which varied and enhanced the graces of earth and ocean .
he was naturally frank; the continued absence of perdita and myself became remarkable; and raymond soon found relief from the constraint of months, by an unreserved confidence with his two friends .
she hesitated some time, but at length she formed her determination .
i walked and, i believe, descended, but i presently found a great alteration in my sensations .
the king lamented his absence; he loved to repeat his sayings, relate the adventures they had had together, and exalt his talents but here ended his reminiscence .
am i not shunned and hated by all mankind?
some from among the family of man must survive, and these should be among the survivors; that should be my task to accomplish it my own life were a small sacrifice .
as i spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated .
but when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him .
i swear to you, by the earth which i inhabit, and by you that made me, that with the companion you bestow i will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places .
all resort for ambition or pleasure was cut off the streets were grass grown the houses empty the few, that from necessity remained, seemed already branded with the taint of inevitable pestilence .
philosophers opposed their principles, as barriers to the inundation of profligacy or despair, and the only ramparts to protect the invaded territory of human life; the religious, hoping now for their reward, clung fast to their creeds, as the rafts and planks which over the tempest vexed sea of suffering, would bear them in safety to the harbour of the unknown continent .
the streets were blocked up, the ruins smoking; i climbed up one heap, only to view others in succession; and nothing told me where the centre of the town might be, or towards what point raymond might have directed his course .
i knew this, but at other times i was unreasonable and laid the blame upon him, who was most blameless, and pevishly thought that if his gentle soul were more gentle, if his intense sympathy were more intense, he could drive the fiend from my soul and make me more human .
the nearer i approached to your habitation, the more deeply did i feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart .
i saw his astronomical instruments put to strange uses, his globes defaced, his papers covered with abstruse calculations destroyed .
that name has so often been degraded that it will not convey the idea of all that he was .
the leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well i had succeeded .
one or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and i shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage .
large estates were secured to the dethroned monarch and his family; he received the title of earl of windsor, and windsor castle, an ancient royalty, with its wide demesnes were a part of his allotted wealth .
but the overflowing misery i now felt, and the excess of agitation that i endured rendered me incapable of any exertion .
how i have lived i hardly know; many times have i stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain and prayed for death .
my father still desired to delay our departure, fearful that i could not sustain the fatigues of a journey, for i was a shattered wreck the shadow of a human being .
look into the mind of man, where wisdom reigns enthroned; where imagination, the painter, sits, with his pencil dipt in hues lovelier than those of sunset, adorning familiar life with glowing tints .
quitting the seven towers, i rode eastward towards the sweet waters .
do not suppose that i am wicked or foolish enough to found my purposed sovereignty on a fraud, and one so easily discovered as the truth or falsehood of the earl 's insanity .
my aunt observed this, and when justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house .
trade was stopped by the failure of the interchange of cargoes usual between us, and america, india, egypt and greece .
clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and i, although i abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which nature adorns her chosen dwelling places .
the difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement .
after many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence .
his person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest i had ever heard .
in life i dared not; in death i unveil the mystery .
the thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door was off its hinges .
everything favoured my journey .
i had commenced my search late in the day, a november day, that closed in early with pattering rain and melancholy wind .
he requested me in the meantime to ride through the camp, and to observe and report to him the dispositions of the soldiers; he then left me .
there i shrunk and fled from him, now i only wished to be with him that i might soothe him to peace .
the winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps i may sail sooner than i expected .
when i appeared, she turned away, and in reply to my enquiries, only said,  ''you know not what you have done '' i trusted that this sullenness betokened merely the struggle between disappointment and natural affection, and that in a few days she would be reconciled to her fate .
experience demonstrated that in a year or two pestilence would cease; it were well that in the mean time we should not have destroyed our fine breeds of horses, or have utterly changed the face of the ornamented portion of the country .
you purpose to kill me .
for her children 's sake alone she consented to remain, shorn of regality, a member of the english republic .
how very dear she was to perdita in progress of time, i also became a father, and our little darlings, our playthings and delights, called forth a thousand new and delicious feelings .
why should our dwelling place be so lovely, and why should the instincts of nature minister pleasurable sensations?
i was trembling and my pillow was wet with my tears; for a few moments my heart beat hard, but the bright beams of the sun and the chirping of the birds quickly restored me to myself, and i rose with a languid spirit, yet wondering what events the day would bring forth .
for a moment she thought that she could stem the torrent, and that raymond could be induced to hear reason from her  . vain hope the moment of her influence was passed.
one star only trembled in the depth of the kindling atmosphere .
 ''that is also my victim '' he exclaimed .
even the poor deer, our antlered proteges, were obliged to fall for the sake of worthier pensioners .
my view was bounded only by the horizon except on one side where a distant wood made a black spot on the heath, that every where else stretched out its faint hues as far as the eye could reach, wide and very desolate .
i saw this smile fade for ever .
it was not long since i was like one of these beardless aspirants; when my boy shall have obtained the place i now hold, i shall have tottered into a grey headed, wrinkled old man .
how would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother i am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties .
 ''let this last but twelve months, '' said adrian;  ''and earth will become a paradise .
i confess to you, my friend, that i love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion .
nor, strange to say, was the time without its pleasures .
it was on a clear morning, in the latter days of december, that i first saw the white cliffs of britain .
the day of my departure at length arrived .
his property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and a beggar .
my attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings .
beside which, his mien conquered me, and an affectionate sentiment towards him, again filled my heart i bade him command me .
now also that our children gave us occupation, we found excuses for our idleness, in the idea of bringing them up to a more splendid career .
she afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots .
god, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance .
we, the arcadian shepherds of the tale, had intended to be present at this festivity, but perdita wrote to entreat us not to come, or to absent ourselves from windsor; for she though she did not reveal her scheme to us resolved the next morning to return with raymond to our dear circle, there to renew a course of life in which she had found entire felicity .
the summer months passed while i was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one pursuit .
it was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood .
the cenci the brides ' tragedy, by t   . l. beddoes, esq.
the sadness with which the former had first heard that the plague was in london had vanished; the energy of his purpose informed his body with strength, the solemn joy of enthusiasm and self devotion illuminated his countenance; and the weakness of his physical nature seemed to pass from him, as the cloud of humanity did, in the ancient fable, from the divine lover of semele .
while i listened to the instructions which felix bestowed upon the arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me .
 ''i expected this, '' cried perdita;  ''i supposed that you would treat me as a mad, foolish girl .
his tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations, and did i not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow?
we lie down, and close our eyes with a gentle good night, and when we wake, we are free .
yet, to the honour of the english be it recorded, that, although natural disinclination made them delay awhile, yet when the misery of their fellow creatures became glaring, an enthusiastic generosity inspired their decrees .
you must choose between these and your protectorate .
we were surely sufficiently degraded .
my voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; i thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children i could gain the good will and mediation of the old de lacey, i might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors .
more than a third of the members ranged themselves under raymond, and their number was perpetually encreasing .
but i did not believe my errors to be irretrievable, and after much consideration i resolved to return to the cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my party .
 ''but how was i to direct myself?
nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the daemon .
it appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life .
 ''one day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, safie, agatha, and felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own desire, was left alone in the cottage .
in this state i was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that i had lost .
  '''how can i thank you, my best and only benefactor?
they seemed much surprised at my appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm .
but reflection returned with health .
you will wonder then, as i do, at the extent of his accomplishments, and the brilliancy of his talents . ''
we need houses to protect us from the seasons, and behold the materials with which we are provided; the growth of trees with their adornment of leaves; while rocks of stone piled above the plains variegate the prospect with their pleasant irregularity .
the question arose as to where we should deposit him .
they arrived at the age when they were sent to fulfil their destined situations in life; while i, an outcast, with none to lead or drive me forward, paused .
when he was nineteen his mother died .
soon after, when he was alone with me, he said,  ''i have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries . ''
even perdita was unable to understand me .
during our ride up to town, adrian and i discussed and argued upon raymond 's conduct, and his falling off from the hopes of permanent excellence on his part, which he had before given us cause to entertain .
i contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the snowy mountains,   'the palaces of nature,' were not changed .
and i dare enforce this request by relating how miserably i was betrayed into this net of fiery anguish and all my struggles to release myself: indeed if your soul were less pure and bright i would not attempt to exculpate myself to you; i should fear that if i led you to regard me with less abhorrence you might hate vice less: but in addressing you i feel as if i appealed to an angelic judge .
the one he had acquired in greece; the other he had sacrificed to love .
it were madness to calculate upon another winter .
by a strange fatality juliet alone escaped, and she to the last waited on her relatives, and smoothed the pillow of death .
raymond had spoken, thoughtless of her presence, and she, poor child, heard with terror and faith the prophecy of his death .
my wanderings were directed towards the valley of chamounix .
i will be cool, persevering, and prudent .
at fourteen and fifteen i often thought that the time was come when i should commence my pilgrimage, which i had cheated my own mind into believing was my imperious duty: but a reluctance to quit my aunt; a remorse for the grief which, i could not conceal from myself, i should occasion her for ever withheld me .
i dared not die, but i might feign death, and thus escape from my comforters: they will believe me united to my father, and so indeed i shall be .
through this work i obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different nations of the earth .
we ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but i was unable to contain myself .
justine, poor, good justine, is innocent . ''
you dream that you can restore him?
go, devoted one, and return thus this is my curse, a daughter 's curse: go, and return pure to thy child, who will never love aught but thee .
fortunately, as i spoke my native language, mr  . kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.
happiness is in its highest degree the sister of goodness .
here i paused, i knew not why; but i remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street .
our party at length broke up;  ''we are all dreaming this morning, '' said ryland,  ''it is as wise to discuss the probability of a visitation of the plague in our well governed metropolis, as to calculate the centuries which must escape before we can grow pine apples here in the open air . ''
it was difficult to find an immediate remedy .
for a long time he was obstinate .
but i will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while i am wafted towards england and towards you, i will not despond .
when i reflected on the work i had completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal, i could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors .
yet a feeling of awe, a breathless sentiment of wonder, a painful sense of the degradation of humanity, was introduced into every heart .
i cannot set my heart to a particular tune, or run voluntary changes on my will .
yet let us go england is in her shroud, we may not enchain ourselves to a corpse .
my tenderness and affection must soothe you; the society of raymond 's friends will be of more solace than these dreary speculations .
we put in movement every impulse of policy and money to redeem him from their hands .
i cannot describe the tumult of emotions that arose within me as i read it .
i fear, my friend, that i shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and i think of them with pleasure .
a second thought passed, swift as an arrow, into her brain; she rushed to the window; and a flash of lightning shewed to her the expected vision, her lover in the shrubbery beneath; joy lent her strength to descend the stairs, to open the door, and then she fainted in his supporting arms .
the spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps .
this is the most favourable period for travelling in russia .
i may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent forever .
in the north it was worse the lesser population gradually declined, and famine and plague kept watch on the survivors, who, helpless and feeble, were ready to fall an easy prey into their hands .
early in the morning raymond came to me; intelligence had arrived that adrian was dangerously ill, and it appeared impossible that his failing strength should surmount the disorder .
the massy portals of the churches swung creaking on their hinges; and some few lay dead on the pavement .
they came from the east and the north, and directed their course without apparent motive, but unanimously towards our unhappy metropolis .
before it had been a rumour; but now in words uneraseable, in definite and undeniable print, the knowledge went forth .
the poor perceived that the rich possessed other means of preservation than those which could be partaken of by themselves, seclusion, and, as far as circumstances permitted, freedom from care .
answer me, i conjure you by our mutual happiness, with simple truth do you not love another?
i am its dupe no longer .
the door of the house from which these sounds proceeded was open, the upper rooms were illuminated as for a feast .
on her return, at about nine o 'clock, she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost .
the way in which adrian had received his project for setting him up as a candidate for the protectorship, and his replies, had already awakened in his mind, the view of the subject which we were now discussing .
but this was not enough .
it is far better for your peace that you should be ignorant of my destination .
they might even hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form?
he did not join as usual in the playful spirit of the rest; but, entering into conversation with adrian and myself, by degrees we seceded from our companions, and idris and perdita only remained with the children .
the storm appeared to approach rapidly, and, on landing, i ascended a low hill, that i might observe its progress .
we call the supernal lights fixed, yet they wander about yonder plain, and if i look again where i looked an hour ago, the face of the eternal heavens is altered .
before i depart i will give them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present, as the sun is already far declined, i shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you .
no unseemly sights were therefore discernible: the shops were in general open, the concourse of passengers in some degree kept up .
at once, i seemed to awake; i cast off the clinging sloth of the past months; earth assumed a new appearance, and my view of the future was suddenly made clear .
were i now to commit an act which would annihilate my hopes, and pluck the regal garment from my mortal limbs, to clothe them in ordinary weeds, would this, think you, be an act of free will on my part? ''
yet untill i find him i must force reason to keep her seat, and i pressed my forehead hard with my hands oh do not leave me; or i shall forget what i am about instead of driving on as we ought with the speed of lightning they will attend to me, and we shall be too late .
the night was windless, hot, and cloudy; her load became too heavy for her; and one by one she threw away her loaves, still endeavouring to get along, though her hobbling fell into lameness, and her weakness at last into inability to move .
as time passed away i became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my heart, but i no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them .
i feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self .
there was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me; and should i feel kindness towards my enemies?
raymond sat among them, though while he entered into the spirit of the hour, his natural dignity never forsook him .
 ''the next morning felix went out to his work, and after the usual occupations of agatha were finished, the arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes .
one moment we seized before our departure, to take leave of our beloved girls .
would an architect be permitted to see the artist?
 ''i come to you, '' he said,  ''only half assured that you will assist me in my project, but resolved to go through with it, whether you concur with me or not .
the guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned .
i see him now, excellent and venerable old man his eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their delight his elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain .
where had they fled when the next morning i awoke?
i am not one of your enemies, i believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until i heard that you had yourself declared your guilt .
the blue lake and snow clad mountains they never change; and i think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws .
we rest; a dream has power to poison sleep .
once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and i might be restored to my family in peace and happiness .
as he spoke, his earnest eyes, fixed on me, seemed to read my very soul: my heart, my savage revengeful heart, felt the influence of sweet benignity sink upon it; while his thrilling voice, like sweetest melody, awoke a mute echo within me, stirring to its depths the life blood in my frame .
the lightness of heart which had dressed them in masquerade habits, had decorated their tents, and assembled them in fantastic groups, appeared a sin against, and a provocative to, the awful destiny that had laid its palsying hand upon hope and life .
her coarse peasant dress, little consonant apparently with the refinement of feeling which her face expressed, yet in a strange manner accorded with it .
the evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged our walk farther than usual .
the entrance of hecate, and the wild music that followed, took us out of this world .
so saying, he hastened away, vaulted on his horse, and with a gesture as if he gave me his hand to kiss, bade me another laughing adieu .
all these shews of despair struck perdita with affright .
some small change indeed the progress of years brought here; and time, as it is wont, stamped the traces of mortality on our pleasures and expectations .
i read the histories of greece and rome, and of england 's former periods, and i watched the movements of the lady of my heart .
this indeed was the plague .
this breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which i am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes .
the men disdainfully repelled the idea of having deserted the defence of their city; and one, the youngest among them, in answer to the taunt of a sailor, exclaimed,  ''take it, christian dogs take the palaces, the gardens, the mosques, the abode of our fathers take plague with them; pestilence is the enemy we fly; if she be your friend, hug her to your bosoms .
 ''do you cabal also against me, '' said he, laughing;  ''and will you make common cause with raymond, in dragging a poor visionary from the clouds to surround him with the fire works and blasts of earthly grandeur, instead of heavenly rays and airs?
she instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of muhammad .
when i leave this place do not expect to hear from me: i must break all ties that at present exist .
 ''dear madam, '' said adrian,  ''let me entreat you to see him, to cultivate his friendship .
when my guest was a little recovered i had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but i would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose .
three years ago and on that day and hour it shone through the branches and leaves of the beech wood and its beams flickered upon the countenance of him whom i then beheld for the last time .
i was born in england .
the theatres were open and thronged; dance and midnight festival were frequented in many of these decorum was violated, and the evils, which hitherto adhered to an advanced state of civilization, were doubled .
ryland was a man of obscure birth and of immense wealth, inherited from his father, who had been a manufacturer .
 ''i have lost that which adorned and dignified my life; that which linked me to other men .
 ''i swear, '' he cried,  ''by the sun, and by the blue sky of heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again .
you will smile at my allusion, but i will disclose a secret .
as well might cleopatra have worn as an ornament the vinegar which contained her dissolved pearl, as i be content with the love that raymond can now offer me . ''
when we arrived, after a little rest, he led me over the house and pointed out to me the rooms which my mother had inhabited .
every day added to his difficulties; the arrival of fresh vessels with emigrants, the total cessation of commerce, the starving multitude that thronged around the palace of the protectorate, were circumstances not to be tampered with .
they talked of taking london, conquering england calling to mind the long detail of injuries which had for many years been forgotten .
learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow .
never mark me never will i leave this spot .
not one of her relations, for they lay glaring on her with stony eyes .
she tried to reason with him, and finding him inflexible, learned to hate him .
 ''i entreat you to call to your remembrance our first happy life on the shores of loch lomond .
the accounts furnished him, however distorted, of a great and wise nation asserting its right to govern itself, excited his admiration: in early days he became a republican from principle .
the athenians saw in him, not as heretofore, the heroic boy or desperate man, who was ready to die for them; but the prudent commander, who for their sakes was careful of his life, and could make his own warrior propensities second to the scheme of conduct policy might point out .
my sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas .
if mere existence, and not happiness, had been the final end of our being, what need of the profuse luxuries which we enjoy?
not far from my cottage was a small cluster of pines the only trees to be seen for many miles: i had a path cut through the furze from my door to this little wood, from whose topmost branches the birds saluted the rising sun and awoke me to my daily meditation .
once for me, you relinquished the prospect of a crown .
when she again lived, it was only to weep and sigh .
no one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success .
i shall never see the snows of another winter i do believe that i shall never again feel the vivifying warmth of another summer sun; and it is in this persuasion that i begin to write my tragic history .
still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion .
i saw few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends .
we were soon joined by elizabeth .
but neither this assurance, nor the speedy convalescence of our child could restore her, even to the portion of peace she before enjoyed .
i knew that i must travel in a southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my only guide .
wherefore should i see her?
it was a passion that had grown with his growth; it had become entwined with every faculty and every sentiment and only to be lost with life .
it was not as in summer time, when each hour might bring the dreaded fate until summer, we felt sure; and this certainty, short lived as it must be, yet for awhile satisfied her maternal tenderness .
i knew myself when i renounced it .
i compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when i looked upon him, when i saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred .
a feeling of devotion, of duty, of a high and steady purpose, elevated me; a strange joy filled my heart .
the inhabitants of the smaller towns left their houses, pitched tents in the fields, wandering separate from each other careless of hunger or the sky 's inclemency, while they imagined that they avoided the death dealing disease .
it is not pestilence by the god that lives it is not either plague or impending danger that makes us, like birds in harvest time, terrified by a scarecrow, abstain from the ready prey it is base superstition and thus the aim of the valiant is made the shuttlecock of fools; the worthy ambition of the high souled, the plaything of these tamed hares but yet stamboul shall be ours by my past labours, by torture and imprisonment suffered for them, by my victories, by my sword, i swear by my hopes of fame, by my former deserts now awaiting their reward, i deeply vow, with these hands to plant the cross on yonder mosque ''  ''dearest raymond '' interrupted perdita, in a supplicating accent .
unfeeling, heartless creator you had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind .
no flowers lifted up their dew laden cups to meet the dawn; the dry grass had withered on the plains; the burning fields of air were vacant of birds; the cicale alone, children of the sun, began their shrill and deafening song among the cypresses and olives .
my countenance was painted with the hues of ill health and vexation .
they had played together as children, been the confidants of each other 's little secrets, mutual aids and consolers in difficulty and sorrow .
 ''i will most readily accompany you to his abode, '' said the lady,  ''not that i wish that either of us should unburthen ourselves of our debt, which, being no less than your life, must remain unpayable ever .
a number of people from north america, the relics of that populous continent, had set sail for the east with mad desire of change, leaving their native plains for lands not less afflicted than their own .
if your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist, i should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics . ''
when night came on and brought sleep with it, i was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished .
evadne now related the tale of her misfortunes .
i found raymond and perdita together .
the house then dissolved .
it should be a solitary house on a wide plain near no other habitation: where i could behold the whole horizon, and wander far without molestation from the sight of my fellow creatures .
perdita was all kindness and attention to her lord; but she was silent, and beyond words sad .
i tenderly love these friends; i have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them; but they believe that i wish to injure them, and it is that prejudice which i wish to overcome . '
in our boat, upon my native lake, beside the streams and the pale bordering poplars in valley and over hill, my crook thrown aside, a nobler flock to tend than silly sheep, even a flock of new born ideas, i read or listened to adrian; and his discourse, whether it concerned his love or his theories for the improvement of man, alike entranced me .
two years passed in this manner, during which i paid no visit to geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which i hoped to make .
 ''i wish, '' cried she,  ''that i were to die with you; i cannot live in this world of misery . ''
her conversation was full of pointed remark and discernment; in her pleasant alcove, redolent with sweetest flowers, adorned by magnificent casts, antique vases, and copies of the finest pictures of raphael, correggio, and claude, painted by herself, i fancied myself in a fairy retreat untainted by and inaccessible to the noisy contentions of politicians and the frivolous pursuits of fashion .
my heart was full, and i did not answer him, but as i proceeded, i weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale .
the panic struck appeared of more injury, than disease and its natural concomitants .
the scenes that followed, convinced her that she had not yet fathomed the obscure gulph into which she had plunged .
her father, though of high rank, had in the end dissipated his fortune, and even destroyed his reputation and influence through a course of dissolute indulgence .
nov  . th it is only four o 'clock; but it is winter and the sun has already set: there are no clouds in the clear, frosty sky to reflect its slant beams, but the air itself is tinged with a slight roseate colour which is again reflected on the snow that covers the ground.
some few of the lords lieutenant who remained, endeavoured to collect the militia but the ranks were vacant, panic seized on all, and the opposition that was made only served to increase the audacity and cruelty of the enemy .
such were the strange and incredible events, that finally brought about my union with the sister of my best friend, with my adored idris .
it is one of those adversities which hurt instead of purifying the heart; for it is so intense a misery that it hardens dulls the feelings .
he had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity returned .
now my tears are dried; the glow has faded from my cheeks, and with a few words of farewell to you, woodville, i close my work: the last that i shall perform .
 ''to you, lionel, i entrust your sister and her child .
with the numerous soldiers of asia, with all of warlike stores, ships, and military engines, that wealth and power could command, the turks at once resolved to crush an enemy, which creeping on by degrees, had from their stronghold in the morea, acquired thrace and macedonia, and had led their armies even to the gates of constantinople, while their extensive commercial relations gave every european nation an interest in their success .
he called for the people of the house, but could learn nothing from them, except that they knew nothing .
suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed .
we are neither cowards nor fatalists; but, believing that god has placed the means for our preservation in our own hands, we will use those means to our utmost .
he therefore accepted for her, and persuaded her to accede to, a proposal of marriage, from a wealthy greek merchant settled at constantinople .
i was delighted when i first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes .
from the circumstances of her birth and education, idris would have been better fitted for the formulae of ceremony; but the very ease which accompanied such actions with her, arising from habit, rendered them tedious; while, with every drawback, perdita evidently enjoyed her situation .
chairs, as in olden time, and indian palanquins were introduced for the infirm; but else it was nothing singular to see females of rank going on foot to places of fashionable resort .
his birth pleased the aristocracy; his being the candidate recommended by adrian, a man intimately allied to the popular party, caused a number, who had no great reliance either on the duke or mr  . ryland, to range on his side.
she lived to find ambition, as unreal a delusion as love .
on returning through the lane, i saw at a distance the same assemblage of persons which i had left .
she only felt in his embrace a dear assurance that while he possessed her, he would not despair .
i lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage, my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon nearly touched .
no form could be discerned on the terraces of the houses; in the higher parts of the town no moving shadow bespoke the presence of any living being: the very trees waved not, and mocked the stability of architecture with like immovability .
if such lovely creatures were miserable, it was less strange that i, an imperfect and solitary being, should be wretched .
yet he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition .
one idea rushed on my mind; never, never may i speak to him again .
 ''they were not entirely happy .
clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn .
why talk of infancy, manhood, and old age?
you refuse my just demand; i have but one resource, and i devote myself, either in my life or death, to his destruction . ''
i devoted myself to him: imperfect creature that i was, i took myself to task, that i might become worthy of him .
but it would not do: i rated my fortitude too high, or my love too low .
it is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed forever that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed, never more to be heard .
here i met georgio palli, the vice admiral of the greek fleet, a former friend and warm partizan of raymond .
she attended the markets she insisted upon being supplied with food for those who were too poor to purchase it .
he was seized and cast into prison the very day that safie arrived from constantinople to join him .
i learned from werter 's imaginations despondency and gloom, but plutarch taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages .
justine shook her head mournfully .
 ''as yet i looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed .
he can influence the blood thirsty war dogs, while i resist their propensities vainly .
but in every change goodness and affection can find field for exertion and display .
she and my father had been playmates from infancy: diana, even in her childhood had been a favourite with his mother; this partiality encreased with the years of this beautiful and lively girl and thus during his school college vacations they were perpetually together .
she sat at the table; one small hand shaded her eyes from the candle; the other held a pencil; her looks were fixed on a drawing before her, which raymond recognized as the design presented to him .
the woman asked her what she did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer .
my father 's impulses, never under his own controul, perpetually led him into difficulties from which his ingenuity alone could extricate him; and the accumulating pile of debts of honour and of trade, which would have bent to earth any other, was supported by him with a light spirit and tameless hilarity; while his company was so necessary at the tables and assemblies of the rich, that his derelictions were considered venial, and he himself received with intoxicating flattery .
the first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned i remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for support .
as soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove .
her society was my chief solace and delight; and my spirits always rose at the expectation of seeing her .
 ''these wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings .
the feelings of kindness and gentleness which i had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth .
he was, as one the peculiar delight of the gods, railed and fenced in by his own divinity, so that nought but love and admiration could approach him .
i never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that i never saw equalled .
oh the brave power of the bitter north wind which freezes the tears it has caused to shed but i will not bear this; go: the sun will rise and set as before you came, and i shall sit among the pines or wander on the heath weeping and complaining without wishing for you to listen .
i avoided my ancient comrades, and i soon lost them .
but adrian is alone, wifeless, childless, unoccupied .
but this catalogue of favourites to be taken with us, could not be made without grief to think of our heavy losses, and a deep sigh for the many things we must leave behind .
with the quick sensibility peculiar to his temperament, he perceived his power in the brilliant circle to be on the wane .
have any of you, my readers, observed the ruins of an anthill immediately after its destruction?
his good star perpetually shone upon him; a reputation had never before been made so rapidly: it was universal .
i have wandered here many days; the caves of ice, which i only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one which man does not grudge .
but i have one want which i have never yet been able to satisfy, and the absence of the object of which i now feel as a most severe evil, i have no friend, margaret: when i am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there will be none to participate my joy; if i am assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection .
when it was decided that the young earl of windsor should visit cumberland, workmen arrived to put the house and grounds in order for his reception .
i am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere .
the sun 's rays were refracted from the pavement and buildings the stoppage of the public fountains the bad quality of the food, and scarcity even of that, produced a state of suffering, which was aggravated by the scourge of disease; while the garrison arrogated every superfluity to themselves, adding by waste and riot to the necessary evils of the time .
 ''she is innocent, my elizabeth, '' said i,  ''and that shall be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal . ''
you had better return to london with him; you can there make the enquiries agreed upon, concerning the earl of windsor and visit me again to morrow, before you proceed on your journey till then, farewell '' she spoke falteringly, and concluded with a heavy sigh .
child of the sun, and nursling of the tropics, it would expire in these climes .
this warmth of affection, added to the depth of her understanding, and the brilliancy of her imagination, made her beyond words dear to raymond .
in that hour i should die and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice .
my father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection .
this noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; i clasped my hands, and exclaimed aloud,  ''william, dear angel this is thy funeral, this thy dirge '' as i said these words, i perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; i stood fixed, gazing intently: i could not be mistaken .
i agreed to leave the finishing and guardianship of the tomb to the head of the religious establishment at athens, and by the end of october prepared for my return to england .
i demand, and most solemnly i demand if in any way i am the cause of your unhappiness .
he spoke of the state of england; the necessary measures to be taken to ensure its security, and confirm its prosperity .
the devastation was not confined to the towns, but spread throughout the country; the hunter died in the woods, the peasant in the corn fields, and the fisher on his native waters .
you raise me from the dust by this kindness; and i trust that, by your aid, i shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures . '
in this emigration i exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which i had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it .
as yet western europe was uninfected; would it always be so?
he shewed himself collected, gallant and imperial; his commands were prompt, his intuition of the events of the day to me miraculous .
mr  . kirwin is a magistrate, and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night. ''
 ''urged by this impulse, i seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me .
it will contain no reproaches .
after the scene sketched in the preceding pages, perdita had contemplated an entire change in the manners and conduct of raymond .
over the deep grave of my secret i must heap an impenetrable heap of false smiles and words: cunning frauds, treacherous laughter and a mixture of all light deceits would form a mist to blind others and be as the poisonous simoon to me .
my choice was easily made .
the saintly soul of elizabeth shone like a shrine dedicated lamp in our peaceful home .
you will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings .
i need not conjure you to look upon me as one of whom all links that once existed between us are broken .
the apprehension, that raymond had departed for ever, that his name, blended eternally with the past, must be erased from every anticipation of the future, had come slowly upon me .
i will not live the mark of suspicion, the object of jealousy .
after the departure of her father, thought became impressed on her young brow .
reproach is indeed an idle word: for what should i reproach you?  ''allow me in some degree to explain my feeling; without that, we shall both grope in the dark, mistaking one another; erring from the path which may conduct, one of us at least, to a more eligible mode of life than that led by either during the last few weeks .
where was the plague?

my father loved beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances .
my spirit will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus .
the tears that suffused my sister 's eyes when i mentioned our friend, and her heightened colour seemed to vouch for the truth of the reports that had reached me .
let me hear the sweet tones of your beloved voice in peace and calm .
 ''thou wilt ever be the same .
death, cruel and relentless, had entered these beloved walls .
his last injunction to me was that i should be happy; perhaps he did not mean the shadowy happiness that i promised myself, yet it was that alone which i could taste .
suddenly the system of warfare was changed .
how refuse the offers of this generous friend?
i had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend i had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and i banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion .
we met other families on the long walk, enjoying like ourselves the return of the genial season .
i receded to solitude; i had recourse to my books, and my desire again to enjoy the society of adrian became a burning thirst .
this spirit gave a tone of irresistible persuasion to his intercourse with others, so that he seemed like an inspired musician, who struck, with unerring skill, the  ''lyre of mind, '' and produced thence divine harmony .
pareamo aver qui tutto il ben raccolto che fra mortali in piu parte si rimembra .
the enthusiasm that inspired her with this strange joy, blinded her to the horrors about her; but they were intolerably agonizing to me .
if this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, greece had not been enslaved, caesar would have spared his country, america would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of mexico and peru had not been destroyed .
it was not adviseable to wait this sad consummation in our native country; but travelling would give us our object for each day, that would distract our thoughts from the swift approaching end of things .
so you are about to love her, but do not already? ''
i feel that i know what ought to be done, and as my presence is necessary for the accomplishment of my plans, i will take especial care to preserve my life .
chapter nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear .
and then swiftly he dispatched his aides de camp to command the horse to fall on the routed enemy .
listen to me, frankenstein .
at length perdita dismissed her .
i was for some time ignorant of this and thought that my excessive weakness was the consequence of the fever; sic but my strength became less and less; as winter came on i had a cough; and my sunken cheek, before pale, burned with a hectic fever .
now, i looked on the evening star, as softly and calmly it hung pendulous in the orange hues of sunset .
when rocked by the waves of the lake my spirits rose in triumph as a horseman feels with pride the motions of his high fed steed .
i had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment when i should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings .

there was a large estate with a mansion attached to it, belonging to this family, at ulswater .
she would wander out at night to get food, and returned home, pleased that she had met no one, that she was in no danger from the plague .
the curse of allah is on stamboul, share ye her fate . ''
the prospect did not move me to fear; yet when i thought of my beloved elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first i had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and i resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter struggle .
i cannot tell you how it adds to my grief to know that i am the cause of uneasiness to you; but this will pass away, and i hope that soon we shall be as we were a few months ago .
let him confide his misery to another heart and half the weight of it will be lightened .
his genius was transcendant, and when it rose as a bright star in the east all eyes were turned towards it in admiration .
for myself, i will not voluntarily seek death, that is, i will not, while i can command myself; and i can here .
at length we saw the numerous steeples of london, st  . paul 's towering above all, and the tower famed in english history.
i told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising .
but i concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever watchful and nicer eye of elizabeth .
no word of comment followed; each reader made his own fearful one .
there was neither jealousy, inquietude, or mistrust in his sentiment; it was devotion and faith .
we landed, and proceeded to paris .
chapter  ''cursed, cursed creator why did i live?
my trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and i am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me .
idris was well content with this resolve of mine .
artillery and arms were collected; the remnants of such regiments, as could be brought through many losses into any show of muster, were put under arms, with that appearance of military discipline which might encourage our own party, and seem most formidable to the disorganized multitude of our enemies .
she was not content that, even for a time, he should practice concealment with her .
we walked together in the gardens and in the evening when i would have retired he asked me to stay and read to him; and first said,  ''when i was last here your mother read dante to me; you shall go on where she left off . ''
soon after idris, who was at the harp, turned to that passionate and sorrowful air in figaro,  ''porgi, amor, qualche risforo, '' in which the deserted countess laments the change of the faithless almaviva .

 ''i have powers; my countrymen think well of them .
 ''safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure, before which time the turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer; and felix remained with them in expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection .
such was his choice: he expected to die .
i had one female servant who spent the greater part of the day at a village two miles off .
but to convince you that selfish feeling does not entirely engross me i shall remain in this town untill you have made by letter every arrangement that you judge necessary .
he might dissect, anatomize, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him .
i was in the wrong to commence a system of concealment; but i did it for the sake of sparing you pain; and each day has rendered it more difficult for me to alter my plan .
as he walked among other men he seemed encompassed with a heavenly halo that divided him from and lifted him above them .
my aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended .
there were many dear friends whom we must not leave behind, humble though they were .
those were the last moments of my life during which i enjoyed the feeling of happiness .
she embraced elizabeth and said in a voice of half suppressed emotion,  ''farewell, sweet lady, dearest elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer live, and be happy, and make others so . ''
you will find a happy, cheerful home and friends who love you dearly .

my first real knowledge of myself was as an unprotected orphan among the valleys and fells of cumberland .
i had been excited to the utmost by the proceedings of the day, and now more than ever by the passionate language of raymond .
raymond began the conversation somewhat abruptly .
in the meantime i took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack me .
 ''you are sorrowful, my love .
the first secret that had existed between them was the visits of raymond to evadne .
we got into his carriage, and proceeded towards windsor .
let me lay my head near your heart; let me die in your arms '' he sunk to the earth fainting, while i, nearly as lifeless, gazed on him in despair .
i know not; i lost sensation, and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me .
but now, when i appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were suddenly extinguished, and i lost all trace of him more utterly than i had ever done before .
 ''i loved you i love you neither anger nor pride dictates these lines; but a feeling beyond, deeper, and more unalterable than either .
raymond was as usual courteous, though there was, on occasions, an unbidden haughtiness, or painful abruptness in his manners, which startled his gentle friend; his brow was not clouded but disdain sat on his lips, and his voice was harsh .
at every inn where we changed horses we heard of him, and i was possessed by alternate hope and fear .
she dared not be present at the contest; yet she remained at home a prey to double solicitude .
perdita looked up; she saw his angry glance; his hand was on the lock of the door .
he composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure .
i have often wondered at the subject of her verses, and at the english dress of the latin poet .
but you will, i hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge . ''
at the foot of this sublime chasm, a fertile laughing valley reached from sea to sea, and beyond was spread the blue aegean, sprinkled with islands, the light waves glancing beneath the sun .
still adrian was unable to guess the truth; he entreated them to visit us at windsor, and they promised to come during the following month .
 ''when my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor justine, who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection .
as we went he reminded me of what i was to say and do, yet, strange to say, i entered the chamber without having once reflected on my purpose .
on hearing this word, felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and i beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression .
few people had discovered some cowardice and much infirmity of purpose under this imposing exterior .
after so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find that i was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey, and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my return, have restored me entirely to myself .
evadne made it her earnest request that the tale of their loves should not be revealed to his mother; and after for a while contesting the point, he yielded it to her .
the murderous mark of the fiend 's grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips .
she answered that i was right, and might do with her as i pleased .
ambition turned his thoughts from these designs ambition, which labouring through various lets and hindrances, had now led him to the summit of his hopes, in making him lord protector of england .
know yourself, raymond, and your indignation will cease; your complacency return .
let fancy pourtray the joyous scene of the twentieth of june, such as even now my aching heart recalls it .
i was an outcast and a vagabond, when adrian gently threw over me the silver net of love and civilization, and linked me inextricably to human charities and human excellence .
there was somthing in those dark deep orbs so liquid, and intense that even in happiness i could never meet their full gaze that mine did not overflow .
i was always conscious of my state when my wild thoughts seemed to drive me to insanity, and never betrayed them to aught but silence and solitude .
still he had many friends, admirers of his transcendent talents; his presence in the house, his eloquence, address and imposing beauty, were calculated to produce an electric effect .
 ''do not catechise me, lionel; i will do my duty by her, be assured .
he heard of the passing events of the day; he knew that, if he returned, and resumed his place in society, the entrance was still open, and it required but the will, to surround himself at once with the associations and habits of boyhood .
in spite of her coldness and long absence, he welcomed her with sensibility, displaying such affection as sought to heal the wounds of pride and sorrow, and was repulsed only by her total apparent want of sympathy .
another storm enlightened jura with faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the mole, a peaked mountain to the east of the lake .
soon after, however, felix approached with another man; i was surprised, as i knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances .
i am glad now to feel the current of thought flow through my mind, as the blood through the articulations of my frame; mere existence is pleasure; and i thank god that i live  ''and all ye happy nurslings of mother earth, do ye not echo my words?
i came in during the interval between the third and fourth act .
as soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; i drew his hand forcibly from his face and said,  'child, what is the meaning of this?
when i returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and afterwards of paracelsus and albertus magnus .
the neighbouring minister was engaged to give me lessons in reading, writing and french, but he was without family and his manners even to me were always perfectly characteristic of the profession in the exercise of whose functions he chiefly shone, that of a schoolmaster .
with simplicity and courage she set aside the prejudices and opposition which were obstacles to my happiness, nor scrupled to give her hand, where she had given her heart .
he was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance .
it was after one tremendous day when his eyes had glared on me like lightning and his voice sharp and broken seemed unable to express the extent of his emotion that in the evening when i was alone he joined me with a calm countenance, and not noticing my tears which i quickly dried when he approached, told me that in three days that sic he intended to remove with me to his estate in yorkshire, and bidding me prepare left me hastily as if afraid of being questioned .
besides, in drawing the picture of my early days, i also record those events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when i would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny i find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys .
we spent two months together in this house .
they know our infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified, are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives .
morning broke; and the old woman saw the corpse, marked with the fatal disease, close to her; her wrist was livid with the hold loosened by death .
perdita beheld with affright the encreasing disorder .
nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and i found no shelter .
the position of the stars was my only guide .
i was now about to form another being of whose dispositions i was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness .
this circumstance, added to his well known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous to engage him .
i found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom i read and to whose conversation i was a listener .
i gave him love only .
the light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds .
after travelling day and night i arrived with an anxious, yet a hoping heart, for why should he send for me if it were only to avoid me and to treat me with the apparent aversion that he had in london .
a beautiful creation, he would say, which may claim this superiority to its model, that good and evil is more easily seperated: the good rewarded in the way they themselves desire; the evil punished as all things evil ought to be punished, not by pain which is revolting to all philanthropy to consider but by quiet obscurity, which simply deprives them of their harmful qualities; why kill the serpent when you have extracted his fangs?
i heard the roar of the waters: he held his course right on towards the brink and i became breathless with fear lest he should plunge down the dreadful precipice; i tried to augment my speed, but my knees failed beneath me, yet i had just reached him; just caught a part of his flowing robe, when he leapt down and i awoke with a violent scream .
but at that moment a crash was heard .
i could not see her thus lost, without exerting myself to remedy the evil remediless i knew, if i could not in the end bring her to reconcile herself to raymond .
the happy do not feel poverty for delight is as a gold tissued robe, and crowns them with priceless gems .
you are of this world; i am not .
remember that cleanliness, sobriety, and even good humour and benevolence, are our best medicines . ''
there was a gentleman of small fortune who lived near his family mansion who had three lovely daughters .
it was probable that the inmate was absent, but secure that he had found the right person, our adventurous protector was tempted to enter, to leave a purse on the table, and silently depart .
and then i thought again of his words  ''i will be with you on your wedding night . ''
this same evening his mother and sister arrived .
this poor man, learned as la place, guileless and unforeseeing as a child, had often been on the point of starvation, he, his pale wife and numerous offspring, while he neither felt hunger, nor observed distress .
the physician declared that he died of the plague .
 ''i talk not of others, but myself, '' replied raymond,  ''and i am as fair an example to go by as another .
the immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as omnipotence and i ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here displayed in their most terrific guise .
he was younger, less worn, more passionless than my father and in no degree reminded me of him: he suffered under immediate grief yet its gentle influence instead of calling feelings otherwise dormant into action, seemed only to veil that which otherwise would have been too dazzling for me .
by the application of praise, censure, and exhortation, she tried to seek and strike the fitting chords; and though the melody that followed her touch seemed discord to her, she built her hopes on his talents, and felt sure that she would at last win him .
 ''when night came i quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, i gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings .
on the contrary, the disease gained virulence, while starvation did its accustomed work .
pale and tearful, she almost forgot her duties as hostess; her eyes were fixed on her children .
these reflections have dispelled the agitation with which i began my letter, and i feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as a steady purpose a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye .
is not short payne well borne that brings long ease, and lays the soul to sleep in quiet grave?f  ''do you mark my words; i have learned the language of despair: i have it all by heart, for i am despair; and a strange being am i, joyous, triumphant despair .
to part with what is a part of myself; without whom i have no memory and no futurity?
 ''having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, i retired, for i saw the figure of a man at a distance, and i remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power .
i followed her, and strove to inspire more hope than i could myself entertain; but she shook her head mournfully .
but until then, i conjure you, do not mention or allude to it .
i seized the favourable moment, and endeavoured to awaken in her something beyond the killing torpor of grief .
 ''being thus provided, i resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination .
elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence, but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and trembling, she asked,  ''what is it that agitates you, my dear victor?
idris endeavoured to calm perdita; but the poor girl 's agitation deprived her of all power of self command .
 ''my travels were long and the sufferings i endured intense .
on the third day my mother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event .
but death was no evil to me if the loss of elizabeth were balanced with it, and i therefore, with a contented and even cheerful countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as i imagined, the seal to my fate .
ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true .
his own trusting, devoted, affectionate perdita, whose generous belief galled him doubly, when he remembered the parade of innocence with which it had been exacted .
he is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a turk, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command .
we visited the tomb of the illustrious hampden and the field on which that patriot fell .
indeed, who would credit that justine moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family, could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime? ''
yet he would not propose the separation .
the weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as i plunged yet deeper in the ravine of arve .
none but adrian could have tamed the motley population of london, which, like a troop of unbitted steeds rushing to their pastures, had thrown aside all minor fears, through the operation of the fear paramount .
but a few months have elapsed since i believed that i was all the world to you; and that there was no happiness or grief for you on earth unshared by your mathilda your child: that happy time is no longer, and what i most dreaded in this world is come upon me .
i had chosen night time for our journey to london, that the change and desolation of the country might be the less observable .
he wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes .
my life was like that of an animal, and my mind was in danger of degenerating into that which informs brute nature .
who that knows what  ''life '' is, would pine for this feverish species of existence?
he asked for my sister; and i delivered her message .
i had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and boundless seas .
they have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows . ''
 ''do so, if you will; but i will not .
he would forsake her, england, his friends, the scenes of his youth, the hopes of coming time, he would seek another country, and in other scenes begin life again .
during the early part of my life there is little to relate, and i will be brief; but i must be allowed to dwell a little on the years of my childhood that it may be apparent how when one hope failed all life was to be a blank; and how when the only affection i was permitted to cherish was blasted my existence was extinguished with it .
none but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science .
 ''as i fixed my eyes on the child, i saw something glittering on his breast .
i am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: i am required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing .
my knowledge of the worldly principles of lord raymond, would have ever prevented me from applying to him, however deep my distress might have been .
the sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks .
even music was not wanting: banners floated in the air, and the shrill fife and loud trumpet breathed forth sounds of encouragement and victory .
to some among the poor this was matter of exultation .
a mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains .
all these circumstances were now related to adrian and idris .
why had i not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife?
we left edinburgh in a week, passing through coupar, st  . andrew 's, and along the banks of the tay, to perth, where our friend expected us.
languor was changed to ardour, the slow step converted to a speedy pace, while the hollow murmur of the multitude, inspired by one feeling, and that deadly, filled the air, drowning the clang of arms and sound of music .
the usual one of imports was entirely cut off .
by the reigning god it is true; the paltry earldom of windsor shall no longer content him, who will inherit the rights which must for ever appertain to the person who possesses it .
and i, the nearest kinsman of the earl of windsor, was to propose his election .
return to windsor then, my brother; for such you are by every tie fill the double place my absence imposes on you, and let me, in all my sufferings here, turn my eyes towards that dear seclusion, and say there is peace . ''
her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies .
if it indeed be that; if the efforts of the virtuous now, are to make the future inhabitants of this fair world more happy; if the labours of those who cast aside selfishness, and try to know the truth of things, are to free the men of ages, now far distant but which will one day come, from the burthen under which those who now live groan, and like you weep bitterly; if they free them but from one of what are now the necessary evils of life, truly i will not fail but will with my whole soul aid the work .
a little population occupied its halls .
when they separated felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said,   'good night sweet safie .'
indignation now transported him; his words i guessed were fraught with disdain then turning from his coward followers, he addressed himself to enter the city alone .
now i am the first man in the state, burthen of every ballad, and object of old women 's mumbled devotions .
all the time she could command she spent in solitude .
i ought to have familiarized the old de lacey to me, and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have been prepared for my approach .
she never mentioned her father to perdita, she appeared half afraid when she spoke of him to me, and though i tried to draw her out on the subject, and to dispel the gloom that hung about her ideas concerning him, i could not succeed .
 ''but my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time i reached the environs of geneva .
in my joy i thrust my hand into the live embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain .
its pleasant places were deserted; its temples and palaces were converted into tombs; its energies, bent before towards the highest objects of human ambition, were now forced to converge to one point, the guarding against the innumerous arrows of the plague .
shall we, in these desart halls, under this wintry sky, sit with closed eyes and folded hands, expecting death?
my heart was full of deep affection, but it was calm from its very depth and fulness .
ryland was roused to resistance; he asserted that his sufferance alone had permitted the encrease of this party; but the time for indulgence was passed, and with one motion of his arm he would sweep away the cobwebs that blinded his countrymen .
this, o this may be the last time that you will surround me thus '' abruptly she stopped, and then cried:  ''what have i said?
our eldest in some degree understood the scenes passing around, and at times, he with serious looks questioned me concerning the reason of so vast a desolation .
 ''you talk of the future, '' she said,  ''while the present is all to me .
the aristocratical party, the richest and most influential men in england, appeared less agitated than the others, for the question was to be discussed without their interference .
she understood my gesture; again her head fell; again her fingers worked restlessly .
 ''my father left it where is he?
our change of cheer struck those nearest to us; and, by means of ryland 's servants, the report soon spread that he had fled from the plague in london .
anguish deprived her of presence of mind; she gave up to me and clara the physician  's and nurse's parts; she sat by the bed, holding one little burning hand, and, with glazed eyes fixed on her babe, passed the long day in one unvaried agony .
it soon became known that adrian took great delight in his park and preserves .
he spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can you wonder that these men were moved?
so true it is, that man 's mind alone was the creator of all that was good or great to man, and that nature herself was only his first minister .
my uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country, but ernest never had your powers of application .
we have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities .
do not suppose, however, that i wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness .
as a child i had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science .
when the clouds veiled the sky, and the wind scattered them there and here, rending their woof, and strewing its fragments through the aerial plains then we rode out, and sought new spots of beauty and repose .
whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of austria was not known .
to crown my vexation of spirit, perdita, the visionary perdita, seemed to awake to real life with transport, when she told me that the earl of windsor was about to arrive .
all was uproar, crime, remorse and hate, yet still the tenderest love; and what first awoke me to the firm resolve of conquering my passion and of restoring her father to my child was the sight of your bitter and sympathizing sorrows .
perdita 's questions had ceased; she leaned on my arm, panting with emotions too acute for tears our men pulled alongside the other boat .
tumult filled the before quiet streets women and children deserted their homes, escaping they knew not whither fathers, husbands, and sons, stood trembling, not for themselves, but for their loved and defenceless relations .
what is there in our nature that is for ever urging us on towards pain and misery?
although we were anxious to leave england before the depth of winter, yet we were detained .
the old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the fields .
i continued awe struck and mute he looked smilingly on the poor girl; the smile was his .
i felt the beneficial result of such excitement, in a renewal of those pleasing flights of fancy to which i had long been a stranger .
darkness then came over me and troubled me, but hardly had i felt this when, by opening my eyes, as i now suppose, the light poured in upon me again .
their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor .
it was as the ass and the lap dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and execration .
the rain had ceased; there was no more thunder and lightning; the wind had paused .
it devolved on me to disclose our plan to idris .
come, come, the worst is past: no more grief, tears or despair; were not those the words you uttered?
resentment added also a sting to my censure; and i reprobated raymond 's conduct in severe terms .
yes, he had followed me in my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise .
i was awake, alive, while the brother of death possessed my race .
we were interrupted by an attendant, who announced, that the staff of raymond was assembled in the council chamber .
he came up the while; and his appearance blew aside, with gentle western breath, my cloudy wrath: a tall, slim, fair boy, with a physiognomy expressive of the excess of sensibility and refinement stood before me; the morning sunbeams tinged with gold his silken hair, and spread light and glory over his beaming countenance .
doubtless my words surprised henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which i continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event .
i requested his advice concerning the books i ought to procure .
in other places human beings were seldom seen, and i generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path .
i greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd 's breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, i did not like .
we will nominate adrian, and do our best to bestow on him the power to which he is entitled by his birth, and which he merits through his virtues .
deeper grief oppressed perdita .
sir isaac newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth .
in open ambition or close intrigue, his end was the same to attain the first station in his own country .
she never for a moment credited the story of his death; she resolved instantly to go to greece .
raymond had lost much of his popularity, and was deserted by his peculiar partizans .
but i was not the witness of his grief, for i was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long, long time .
he did not conceive that ever qu .
methought this was but a poor expedient; but i assured him of my obedience and zeal .
 ''my cousin, '' replied i,  ''it is decided as you may have expected; all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape .
he had a feeling that however they might express ridicule of his intended marriage they would not dare display it when it had taken place; therefore seeking the consent of his guardian which with some difficulty he obtained, and of the father of his mistress which was more easily given, without acquainting any one else of his intention, by the time he had attained his twentieth birthday he had become the husband of diana .
the sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains, whose aerial summits hung over its recesses .
he is an englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity .
the poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as i did, such deep and bitter agony .
madame moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom justine was the third .
there were women weeping around; i hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause .
thus untaught in refined philosophy, and pursued by a restless feeling of degradation from my true station in society, i wandered among the hills of civilized england as uncouth a savage as the wolf bred founder of old rome .
but they became every day more ardent and tender .
suddenly one of the choristers died he was lifted from his desk, the vaults below were hastily opened he was consigned with a few muttered prayers to the darksome cavern, abode of thousands who had gone before now wide yawning to receive even all who fulfilled the funeral rites .
satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire and encourage him, but i am solitary and abhorred . '
we all observed the visitation of these feelings, and none regretted them so much as perdita .
for this reason i avoided this high born damsel .
it was not till one of them died that he perceived their danger; one by one they were carried off by pestilence; and his wife, his helpmate and supporter, more necessary to him than his own limbs and frame, which had hardly been taught the lesson of self preservation, the kind companion whose voice always spoke peace to him, closed her eyes in death .
the days that followed were full of pain to me; so that i sometimes regretted that i had not yielded at once to the haughty lady, who watched all my motions, and turned my beloved task of nursing my friend to a work of pain and irritation .
good god margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless .
if any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me, i should return them a hundred and a hundredfold; for that one creature 's sake i would make peace with the whole kind but i now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realized .
strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it thus chapter i am by birth a genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic .
i was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons, to the inn .
the delight of clerval was proportionably greater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors .
at first i wished to hurry on, for i longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when i drew near my native town, i slackened my progress .
 ''did we form ourselves, choosing our dispositions, and our powers?
clara, overcome by weariness, had seated herself at the foot of her cousin 's bed, and in spite of her efforts slumber weighed down her lids; twice or thrice she shook it off; but at length she was conquered and slept .
her servant, however, remained with her .
the horrible scene of the preceding day was forever acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged felix tearing me from his father 's feet .
he had her then removed to a more commodious dwelling, and hovered about her, again and again to assure himself that she was safe .
i now forget the cause of her departure if indeed i ever knew it .
i clasped that kind hand; i tried to answer; a fervent  ''god bless you '' was all my ignorance could frame of speech, and i darted away, oppressed by my new emotions .
the acquisition of unknown languages was too tedious an occupation, for one who referred every expression to the universe within, and read not, as many do, for the mere sake of filling up time; but who was still questioning herself and her author, moulding every idea in a thousand ways, ardently desirous for the discovery of truth in every sentence .
his passions were violent; as these often obtained the mastery over him, he could not always square his conduct to the obvious line of self interest, but self gratification at least was the paramount object with him .
i wished to imitate his example, but men are used to move all together, if they move at all, and i could find no means of leading the inhabitants of scattered towns and villages, who forgot my words as soon as they heard them not, and veered with every baffling wind, that might arise from an apparent change of circumstance .
felix darted forward, and with supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees i clung, in a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick .
oh my creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit let me see that i excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my request '' i was moved .
 ''fear not that i shall be the instrument of future mischief .
there was much kindness, gratitude, and sweetness in her expression, but no love .

chapter the being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the expectation of a reply .
my manly virtues did not desert me, for the witch urania spared the locks of sampson, while he reposed at her feet; but all was softened and humanized .
evadne entered but coldly into his systems .
he asked me the history of my earlier years .
 ''alas alas what am i become?
while he was yet undecided, she had quitted england; the news of his marriage reached her, and her hopes, poorly nurtured blossoms, withered and fell .
the mere flow of animal spirits was paradise, and at night 's close i only desired a renewal of the intoxicating delusion .
in the midst of poverty and want, felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground .
we discussed his chances, the merits of the other candidates, and the dispositions of the voters .
the stinging  ''remorse of love '' now pierced her heart .
when she found herself forsaken by him, she lost the heart to pursue her usual avocations; pride forbade every application to him; famine was welcomed as the kind porter to the gates of death, within whose opening folds she should now, without sin, quickly repose .
our house was the house of mourning .
raymond questioned him; but his reserved answers soon made him turn from the man to the drawing .
we must all remain; and do our best to help our suffering fellow creatures . ''
leave the task of persuasion on that point to me; i do not ask you to assist me there .
and how, victor, can i relate our misfortune?
he heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of cornelius agrippa and paracelsus, but without the contempt that m  . krempe had exhibited.
he was pacing the garden: his passions were in a state of inconceivable turbulence .
he got over his grief for elinor, and the country became dull to him, so he was glad to find even me for amusement; and when he does not know what else to do he passes his lazy hours here, and calls this friendship it is true that his presence is a consolation to me, and that his words are sweet, and, when he will he can pour forth thoughts that win me from despair .
he was courteous, honey tongued an adept in fascinating arts .
yet i will not die; alas how dare i go where i may meet diana, when i have disobeyed her last request; her last words said in a faint voice when all feeling but love, which survives all things else was already dead, she then bade me make her child happy: that thought alone gives a double sting to death .
  'who are you?'  ''at that instant the cottage door was opened, and felix, safie, and agatha entered .
at these moments i took refuge in the most perfect solitude .
 ''that he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in other respects, this hour, when i momentarily expect my release, is the only happy one which i have enjoyed for several years .

farewell, frankenstein if thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction .

she joined the hands of elizabeth and myself .
the feeble and decrepid fled; the warriors retreated, though they threatened even in flight .
clerval spent the last evening with us .
the wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in the west .
to be worthy of her, to raise myself to her height through the exertion of talents and virtue, to repay her love with devoted, unwearied tenderness, were the only thanks i could offer for the matchless gift .
youths, nobles of the land, performed for the sake of mother or sister, the services of menials with amiable cheerfulness .
she rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with her, she threw herself at the feet of elizabeth, weeping bitterly .
sweet and beloved elizabeth i read and reread her letter, and some softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the angel 's arm bared to drive me from all hope .
felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door .
she called to mind how often he had declared that solitude was to him the greatest of all evils, and how death itself was to him more full of fear and pain when he pictured to himself a lonely grave .
adieu, my dear margaret .
her cheek was flushed by the expectation of struggle; her eyes sparkled with the hope of triumph .
let us rather go out to meet it gallantly: or perhaps for all this pendulous orb, this fair gem in the sky 's diadem, is not surely plague striken perhaps, in some secluded nook, amidst eternal spring, and waving trees, and purling streams, we may find life .
i shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks .
every day some new scene occured and displayed in him a mind working as it were with an unknown horror that now he could master but which at times threatened to overturn his reason, and to throw the bright seat of his intelligence into a perpetual chaos .
 ''when i reflect, my dear cousin, '' said she,  ''on the miserable death of justine moritz, i no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me .
but his understanding, his charity, his virtues, want a field for exercise and display; and we will procure it for him .
she felt as if during her past calm she had dreamed, but was now awake; she was as one in some lone watch tower on the deep, awakened from soothing visions of the home he loves, trembling to hear the wrathful billows roar; as one who has been cradled by a storm, and awakes to find the vessel sinking .
but the thing was now going too far .
i knew that it was possible that your suspicions might be excited; but i trusted that my simple word would cause them to disappear .
could there be guilt in it?
i jumped into the boat, and well accustomed to such feats, i pushed it from shore, and exerted all my strength to row swiftly across .
verney, you will acknowledge this tie, and as my brother 's friend, i feel that i may trust you . ''
he was no longer bent to the ground, like an over nursed flower of spring, that, shooting up beyond its strength, is weighed down even by its own coronal of blossoms .
a short month has destroyed a village, and where in may the first person sickened, in june the paths were deformed by unburied corpses the houses tenantless, no smoke arising from the chimneys; and the housewife 's clock marked only the hour when death had been triumphant .
in securing solicitously an unobserved retreat in case of failure, raymond had forgotten to arrange the mode by which she was to hear of his success; and she had been too much agitated to revert to this circumstance .
with earnest gaze she looked on the labyrinth of smoking piles which had been a city, and then expressed her readiness to return home .
the men filled the mosques; the women, veiled, hastened to the tombs, and carried offerings to the dead, thus to preserve the living .
i had before visited the manor houses and gentlemen 's seats, and often found the inhabitants actuated by the purest benevolence, ready to lend their utmost aid for the welfare of their tenants .
he walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his companions followed him at some distance .
this had been the secret of his secession at the time of lord raymond 's election .
 ''but paradise lost excited different and far deeper emotions .
he would talk in a cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me .
to be present at the election of a protector, and to give our yea or nay for his shuffling grace of ? or for that noisy ryland?
she was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects .
man, no longer with an appetite for sympathy, clothed his thoughts in visible signs; nor were there any readers left: while each one, having thrown away his sword with opposing shield alone, awaited the plague, merrival talked of the state of mankind six thousand years hence .
but he was ardent and tender of heart beyond the common nature of man, and had already learnt to love, while the beauteous greek smiled benignantly on the boy .
even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice .
the countess again came to her daughter 's bedside:  ''in austria at least, '' she said,  ''you will obey .
but even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind .
our lazzeroni bore flaring torches, which shone red, and almost dusky, in the murky subterranean passages, whose darkness thirstily surrounding them, seemed eager to imbibe more and more of the element of light .
 ''common affection might have been satisfied with common usages .
in obedience to my request perdita detailed the melancholy circumstances that led to this event .
i read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself .
he seemed incapable of conceiving of the full extent of the power that selfishness vice possesses in the world: when i knew him, although he had suffered disappointment in his dearest hopes, he had not experienced any that arose from the meaness and self love of men: his station was too high to allow of his suffering through their hardheartedness; and too low for him to have experienced ingratitude and encroaching selfishness: it is one of the blessings of a moderate fortune, that by preventing the possessor from confering pecuniary favours it prevents him also from diving into the arcana of human weakness or malice to bestow on your fellow men is a godlike attribute so indeed it is and as such not one fit for mortality; the giver like adam and prometheus, must pay the penalty of rising above his nature by being the martyr to his own excellence .
 ''he is safe '' said idris, as he leapt on shore, and waved the bough over his head in token of success;  ''we will wait for him here . ''
was it not enough that we must die, but toil must be added?
a step approached her bed, she dared not move, she strove to calm her palpitations, which became more violent, when she heard her mother say mutteringly,  ''pretty simpleton, little do you think that your game is already at an end for ever . ''
a thousand times would i have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but i could not, my father, indeed i could not sacrifice the whole human race . ''
it may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but when i see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends, i wish to be allowed to speak, that i may say what i know of her character .
she replied with earnestness,  ''i do not refuse to believe you, raymond; on the contrary i promise to put implicit faith in your simple word .
and again she heard,  ''she will not wake till late to morrow, and we shall then be at sea  . ''  ''all is ready, '' at length the woman announced.
i took the hand of elizabeth .
half insanely i spoke to the dead .
he foresaw that his own life would be one of struggle, and i must partake his labours with him .
they kept better watch; i was taken, and sent to prison .
wordsworth 's  ''tintern abbey '' .
the fresh air revived me, and with renewed determination i approached the door of their cottage .
nations, bordering on the already infected countries, began to enter upon serious plans for the better keeping out of the enemy .
i might have deceived you; i might have talked of remaining here only a few months; in your anxiety to reach windsor you would have left me, and without reproach or contention, i might have pursued my plan .
there is something terribly appalling in our situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me .
her unhappiness assumed every day a new shape; every day some unexpected event seemed to close, while in fact it led onward, the train of calamities which now befell her .
the passage, which at first scarcely admitted us, quickly grew narrower and lower; we were almost bent double; yet still we persisted in making our way through it .
as i could not pass through the town, i was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at plainpalais .
my rage was without bounds; i sprang on him, impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another .
i strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when i distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well known form within  . oh with what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart warm tears filled my eyes, which i hastily wiped away, that they might not intercept the view i had of the daemon; but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that oppressed me, i wept aloud.
at such times the king, in his enthusiasm for him, would come to his relief, and then kindly take his friend to task; my father gave the best promises for amendment, but his social disposition, his craving for the usual diet of admiration, and more than all, the fiend of gambling, which fully possessed him, made his good resolutions transient, his promises vain .
attend, o reader while i narrate this tale of wonders one day as adrian and idris were riding through the forest, with their mother and accustomed companions, idris, drawing her brother aside from the rest of the cavalcade, suddenly asked him,   ''what had become of his friend, lionel verney? ''  ''even from this spot, '' replied adrian, pointing to my sister's cottage,  ''you can see his dwelling . ''
she sat upon the ground absorbed in wordless despair, when through the gusty wind and bickering rain she thought she heard her name called .
as it drew nearer i observed that it was the swiss diligence; it stopped just where i was standing, and on the door being opened, i perceived henry clerval, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out .
he endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium .
men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation .
i strove to quiet the eager dancing of my heart; i turned from her my eyes, beaming with too much tenderness, and proudly, to dark night, and the inclement atmosphere, murmured the expressions of my transport .
 ''i fear, my beloved girl, '' i said,  ''little happiness remains for us on earth; yet all that i may one day enjoy is centred in you .
when he had in some measure recovered, i removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit .
the strange and romantic scheme of her mother, might confirm and perpetuate the painful view of life, which had intruded itself thus early on her contemplation .
he endeavoured to guide with prudence the steeds of destiny through the devious road which he had chosen, and bent all his efforts the better to conceal what he could not alter .
she grieved for the loss of raymond with an anguish, that exiled all smile from her lips, and trenched sad lines on her brow of beauty .
a sudden break was made in the routine of our lives .
a servant in geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in france and england .
the castle walls, and long familiar trees, did not hear the parting sound of our carriage wheels with regret .
a woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found .
he looked up to her as his guide, and such was his adoration that he delighted to augment to his own mind the sense of inferiority with which she sometimes impressed him .
that consideration made me breathless with anguish, and impressing itself on my imagination i was unable for a time to follow up any train of ideas .
his depression and anxiety fled; he became all life and activity .
 ''i continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair .
i always required the stimulants of companionship and applause .
i only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, i did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them .
her tall slim figure bent gracefully as a poplar to the breezy west, and her gait, goddess like, was as that of a winged angel new alit from heaven 's high floor; the pearly fairness of her complexion was stained by a pure suffusion; her voice resembled the low, subdued tenor of a flute .
just at this time adrian came down to us; his eager looks shewed us that he was full of some scheme .
when i looked around i saw and heard of none like me .
he gave orders for the retreat to be sounded, and the regiments repaired in good order to the camp .
the english for the most part talked of thrace and macedonia, as they would of a lunar territory, which, unknown to them, presented no distinct idea or interest to the minds .
a few months before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called paris, surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford .
clerval had never sympathized in my tastes for natural science; and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me .
raymond repeated his instructions, and the visitor retired .
a human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity .
sometimes i thought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion .
i know, though she does not, how false the veil is which she has spread over the reality do not endeavour to rend this deceptive covering, but by degrees withdraw it .
but this was the best side of the question .
but it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that i resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat .
as he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled grief that touched me to the heart .
how dare you sport thus with life?
one living beggar had become of more worth than a national peerage of dead lords alas the day than of dead heroes, patriots, or men of genius .
we are not formed for enjoyment; and, however we may be attuned to the reception of pleasureable emotion, disappointment is the never failing pilot of our life 's bark, and ruthlessly carries us on to the shoals .
there were no carriages, and grass had sprung high in the streets; the houses had a desolate look; most of the shutters were closed; and there was a ghast and frightened stare in the persons i met, very different from the usual business like demeanour of the londoners .
she felt struck by the plague; her aged frame was unable to bear her away with sufficient speed; and now, believing herself infected, she no longer dreaded the association of others; but, as swiftly as she might, came to her grand daughter, at windsor castle, there to lament and die .
he soon reached the summit, and disappeared .
the spirit of existence was dead within me; be not surprised therefore that when it came i welcomed not more gladly, or when it departed i lamented not more bitterly the best gift of heaven a friend .
i procured laudanum and placing it in two glasses on the table, filled my room with flowers and decorated the last scene of my tragedy with the nicest care .
but the consideration of these points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, i leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death .
they ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe .
alas, poor country; almost afraid to know itself it cannot be called our mother, but our grave: where nothing, but who knows nothing, is once seen to smile; where sighs, and groans, and shrieks that rent the air, are made, not marked; where violent sorrow seems a modern extasy: the dead man  's knell is there scarce asked, for who; and good men's lives expire before the flowers in their caps, dying, or ere they sicken .
my convalescence rapidly advanced, yet this was the thought that haunted me, and i was for ever forming plans how i might hereafter contrive to escape the tortures that were prepared for me when i should mix in society, and to find that solitude which alone could suit one whom an untold grief seperated from her fellow creatures .
the young are seldom in elysium, for their desires, outstripping possibility, leave them as poor as a moneyless debtor .
by heaven the first tears i have shed since boyhood rushed scalding into my eyes when i saw him . ''
his voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his effort, he sank into silence .
shriek, ye clarions ye loud trumpets, howl pile dirge on dirge; rouse the funereal chords; let the air ring with dire wailing; let wild discord rush on the wings of the wind already i hear it, while guardian angels, attendant on humanity, their task achieved, hasten away, and their departure is announced by melancholy strains; faces all unseemly with weeping, forced open my lids; faster and faster many groups of these woe begone countenances thronged around, exhibiting every variety of wretchedness well known faces mingled with the distorted creations of fancy .
one day, when my father had gone by himself to milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited this abode .
i must fly from him with more earnestness than from my greatest enemy: in solitude or in cities i must never more behold him .
elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness .
look not on the star, dear love, or do, and let that eternal spark plead for me; let it be my witness and my advocate, silent as it shines love is to me as light to the star; even so long as that is uneclipsed by annihilation, so long shall i love you . ''
we saw tilbury fort and remembered the spanish armada, gravesend, woolwich, and greenwich places which i had heard of even in my country .
but so blind is the experience of man that what i conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it .
i came out, my morals unimproved, my hatred to my oppressors encreased tenfold .
clara got rid also of her restraint; adrian and she had been old playfellows; and now, as they walked or rode together, he yielded to her earnest entreaty, and repeated, for the hundredth time, some tale of her father 's bravery, munificence, or justice .
did you not call this a glorious expedition?
quito was destroyed by an earthquake .
her expectations had been strongly excited; she had urged nothing against our project, on the contrary, she was evidently pleased by it; but its evident ill success changed the current of her ideas .
i am prepared, so that i leave behind a trail of light so radiant, that my worst enemies cannot cloud it .
i called it rapture, when a smile made my heart beat; and i felt the life 's blood tingle in my frame, when i approached the idol which for awhile i worshipped .
i could no longer attend to my occupations; all my plans and devices were forgotten; i seemed about to begin life anew, and that under no good auspices .
promise me secrecy however; for if you will not contribute to my success, at least you must not baffle me  . ''  ''well, i promise.
they hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence . ''
the summer sun shone in an unclouded sky; the air was close but all was cool to me except my own scorching skin .
bitter task was it, to behold his spirit waver between death and life: to see his warm cheek, and know that the very fire which burned too fiercely there, was consuming the vital fuel; to hear his moaning voice, which might never again articulate words of love and wisdom; to witness the ineffectual motions of his limbs, soon to be wrapt in their mortal shroud .
alas i did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity .
but these were few, in comparison to the numbers who actually crossed .
 ''the repetition would be useless, '' said raymond,  ''since i well remember them, and have many others, self suggested, which speak with unanswerable persuasion . ''
gratitude and praise marked where her footsteps had been .
their intercourse continued .
alas why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life?
i paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber .
be it light with him when it is darkness with me let him feel the sun of summer while i am chilled by the snows of winter let there be the distance of the antipodes between us at length the east began to brighten, and the comfortable light of morning streamed into my room .
and yet i dared not request him to use his influence that i might obtain an honourable provision for myself for then i should have been obliged to leave windsor .
yet though lovely and full of noble feeling, my poor perdita for this was the fanciful name my sister had received from her dying parent, was not altogether saintly in her disposition .
 ''how can i move thee?
if some scene of tremendous agony shook my frame and fevered my brow, i would lay my head on the lap of idris, and the tumultuous pulses subsided into a temperate flow her smile could raise me from hopelessness, her embrace bathe my sorrowing heart in calm peace .
there was the spirited and obedient steed which lord raymond had given his daughter; there was alfred 's dog and a pet eagle, whose sight was dimmed through age .
i read it, as i had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a true history .
yet at this time, with human fondness, she clung to all that her human senses permitted her to see and feel to be a part of raymond .
in spite of the misery i deprecated, and could not understand; in spite of the cold hearths of wide london, and the corpse strewn fields of my native land; in spite of all the variety of agonizing emotions i had that evening experienced, i thought that in reply to our melodious adjurations, the creator looked down in compassion and promise of relief; the awful peal of the heaven winged music seemed fitting voice wherewith to commune with the supreme; calm was produced by its sound, and by the sight of many other human creatures offering up prayers and submission with me .
when he was silent i tried to divert him, and when sometimes i stole to him during the energy of his passion i wept but did not desire to leave him .
 ''god knows, '' she said,  ''how entirely i am innocent .
if the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet, again, i considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate .
evadne was eighteen years of age .
i might waste days in describing how anxiously i watched every change of fleeting circumstance that promised better days, and with what despair i found that each effort of mine aggravated his seeming madness .
orphans, in the fullest sense of the term, we were poorest among the poor, and despised among the unhonoured .
when these circumstances were reported to raymond, he caused minute observations to be made as to what was doing within the walls, and when his scouts returned, reporting only the continued silence and desolation of the city, he commanded the army to be drawn out before the gates .
daedalus never wound so inextricable an error round minotaur, as madness has woven about his imprisoned reason .
methought that, adrian withdrawn from active life, and this beauteous idris, a victim probably to her mother 's ambitious schemes, i ought to come forward to protect her from undue influence, guard her from unhappiness, and secure to her freedom of choice, the right of every human being .
in answer to our eager questions, one word alone fell, as it were involuntarily, from his convulsed lips: the plague .
i shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should i have any fresh incidents to record .
strange to say the result perhaps of the concussion of air occasioned by the blowing up of the city huge, white thunder clouds lifted themselves up from the southern horizon, and gathered over head; they were the first blots on the blue expanse that i had seen for months, and amidst this havoc and despair they inspired pleasure .
tears streamed from my eyes .
i know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing; or, if i had, why should he have stolen the jewel, to part with it again so soon?
i mentioned this to perdita .
the sailors on watch rushed to the side of the vessel, with the cry some one gone overboard .
when the seasons have become equal, when the air breeds no disorders, when its surface is no longer liable to blights and droughts, then sickness will cease; when men 's passions are dead, poverty will depart .
there was one man, he continued, who wished to alter all this, and bring us back to our days of impotence and contention: one man, who would dare arrogate the honour which was due to all who claimed england as their birthplace, and set his name and style above the name and style of his country .
her love gave birth to sympathy; her intelligence made her understand him at a word; her powers of intellect enabled her to assist and guide him .
but an earthquake had changed the scene under our very feet the earth yawned deep and precipitous the gulph below opened to receive us, while the hours charioted us towards the chasm .
it was as i said, the nineteenth of october; the autumn was far advanced and dreary .
 ''indeed it does, lionel, '' she replied;  ''i quite long to see him; he is the descendant of our kings, the first noble of the land: every one admires and loves him, and they say that his rank is his least merit; he is generous, brave, and affable . ''
i rambled amidst the wild scenery of this lovely country and became a complete mountaineer: i passed hours on the steep brow of a mountain that overhung a waterfall or rowed myself in a little skiff to some one of the islands .
but it was winter now, and months must elapse before we are hurled from our security .
but that my firm courage and cheerful exertions might shelter the dear mate, whom i chose in the spring of my life; though the throbbings of my heart be replete with pain, though my hopes for the future are chill, still while your dear head, my gentlest love, can repose in peace on that heart, and while you derive from its fostering care, comfort, and hope, my struggles shall not cease, i will not call myself altogether vanquished .
she told me, that that same evening william had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother .
they should not die first i would be gathered to nothingness, ere infection should come anear these idols of my soul .
one instance of this kind came immediately under our notice, where a high born girl had in early youth given her heart to one of meaner extraction .
 ''this is better, mamma, '' said clara,  ''than being in that dismal london, where you often cry, and never laugh as you do now . ''
she perished on the scaffold as a murderess from the tortures of my own heart, i turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my elizabeth .
love had come, as the rod of the master prophet, to swallow up every minor propensity .
the pause was but for a moment; the flood of association and natural feeling which had been checked, again rushed in full tide upon our hearts, and with tenderest emotion we were swiftly locked in each other 's embrace .
a sister or a brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early, suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend, however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be contemplated with suspicion .
it was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling me aside, thus addressed me,  ''i am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself .
 ''the days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends .
with him went enthusiasm, the high wrought resolve, the eye that without blenching could look at death .
this ironical tone was discord to my bursting, over boiling heart; i was nettled by his insolence, and replied with bitterness;  ''there is a spirit, neither angel or devil, damned to limbo merely . ''
clara had passed the age which, from its mute ignorance, was the source of the fears of idris .
m  . waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress i had made in the sciences.
she looked at the hand writing, which she could not mistake, and repeated to herself the words  ''do not, i charge you, i entreat you, permit your guests to wonder at my absence: '' the while the old crone going on with her talk, filled her ear with a strange medley of truth and falsehood .
we feared the balmy air we feared the cloudless sky, the flower covered earth, and delightful woods, for we looked on the fabric of the universe no longer as our dwelling, but our tomb, and the fragrant land smelled to the apprehension of fear like a wide church yard .
arrived at the same point of the world 's age there was no difference in us; the name of parent and child had lost their meaning; young boys and girls were level now with men .
this winter has been passed most miserably, tortured as i have been by anxious suspense; yet i hope to see peace in your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort and tranquillity .
the road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as i approached my native town .
i distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as       'good,' 'dearest,' 'unhappy .'
it was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as i was .
the servant instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition, justine was apprehended .
encouraged by this encomium, i proceeded, in answer to his inquiries, to relate what i remembered of my parent; and he gave an account of those circumstances which had brought about a neglect of my father 's testamentary letter .
this idea was intolerably painful to him .
no one can conceive the anguish i suffered during the remainder of the night, which i spent, cold and wet, in the open air .
the veil must be thicker than that invented by turkish jealousy; the wall higher than the unscaleable tower of vathek, which should conceal from her the workings of his heart, and hide from her view the secret of his actions .
when i had ceased to weep reason and memory returned upon me, and i began to reflect with greater calmness on what had happened, and how it became me to act a few hours only had passed but a mighty revolution had taken place with regard to me the natural work of years had been transacted since the morning: my father was as dead to me, and i felt for a moment as if he with white hairs were laid in his coffin and i youth vanished in approaching age, were weeping at his timely dissolution .
i wish to soothe him, yet can i counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live?
might he not many, many years hence, when age had quenched the burning sensations that he now experienced, might he not then be again a father to me?
when the fever of my young life is spent; when placid age shall tame the vulture that devours me, friendship may come, love and hope being dead .
i cannot say with what passion i loved every thing even the inanimate objects that surrounded me .
it became a question whether he had fallen among the unrecognized; but no broken ornament or stained trapping betrayed his fate .
he was seldom at the palace; never, but when he was assured that his public duties would prevent his remaining alone with perdita .
he had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation .
you hold forth your hand; it is even as a part of yourself; and you do not yet divide the feeling of identity from the mortal form that shapes forth lionel .
thus i might proclaim myself a madman, but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim .
she fell, however, into good hands .
posterity became my heirs .
these sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that i was capable of receiving .
i continued:  ''this poor wretch is deserted, dying, succourless; in these unhappy times, god knows how soon any or all of us may be in like want .
i burned with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean .
his countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and he replied,  ''to seek one who fled from me . ''  ''and did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion? ''
and if these were my sensations, who can describe those of henry?
the king, who was a man of excellent dispositions, but easily led, had now become a willing disciple of his imperious consort .
was the coming painful?
 ''i cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; i tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge .
one sheet of white covered it, while bitter recollection told me that cold as the winter clothed earth, were the hearts of the inhabitants .
they looked at the pictures, strolled into the other apartments, talked of billiards, and one by one vanished .
when i awoke it rained: i was already quite wet, and my limbs were stiff and my head giddy with the chill of night .
how kind, how very kind but where is he, why does he not hasten to me? '' my change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium, and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence .
what had been hardly won, was now, entirely possessed, doubly dear .
they left me in an hour 's time .
through long habit they had become a part of himself; his want of worldly knowledge, his absence of mind and infant guilelessness, made him utterly dependent on them .
i am already far north of london, and as i walk in the streets of petersburgh, i feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight .
all the genius that ennobled the blood of her father illustrated hers; a generous tide flowed in her veins; artifice, envy, or meanness, were at the antipodes of her nature; her countenance, when enlightened by amiable feeling, might have belonged to a queen of nations; her eyes were bright; her look fearless .
from this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger .
but the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and i gradually recovered my health .
she now took pleasure in my society; towards idris she felt and displayed a full and affectionate sense of her worth she restored to her child in abundant measure her tenderness and care .
i have one secret, elizabeth, a dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only wonder that i survive what i have endured .
as manhood dawned upon him, his schemes and theories, far from being changed by personal and prudential motives, acquired new strength from the powers he felt arise within him; and his love for evadne became deep rooted, as he each day became more certain that the path he pursued was full of difficulty, and that he must seek his reward, not in the applause or gratitude of his fellow creatures, hardly in the success of his plans, but in the approbation of his own heart, and in her love and sympathy, which was to lighten every toil and recompence every sacrifice .
 ''my brother, '' she cried,  ''protector of my childhood, dear, most dear lionel, my fate hangs by a thread .
yet active life was the genuine soil for his virtues; and he sometimes suffered tedium from the monotonous succession of events in our retirement .
i hastily gave my consent to this arrangement, and as hastily formed a plan through which perdita should be forced to become my companion .
i no longer exhaust my miserable heart by bitter tears and frantic complaints; i no longer the sic reproach the sun, the earth, the air, for pain and wretchedness .
the latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and as he said this i could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me .
the pines are not tall or luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene .
in the university whither i was going i must form my own friends and be my own protector .
the pomp of rank, the assumption of power, the possessions of wealth vanished like morning mist .
this action of adrian provoked me .
 ''when the news reached leghorn that felix was deprived of his wealth and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover, but to prepare to return to her native country .
but we must live, and not act our lives; pursuing the shadow, i lost the reality now i renounce both .
well, we removed to london, and still i felt only the peace of sinless passion .
what is it you fear? ''  ''oh peace, peace, my love, '' replied i;  ''this night, and all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful . ''
sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor .
the little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me .
adrian was on horseback; he rode up to the carriage, and his gaiety, in addition to that of raymond, dispelled my sister 's melancholy .
were your sister indeed the insignificant person she deserves to be, i would willingly leave her to the fate, the wretched fate, of the wife of a man, whose very person, resembling as it does his wretched father, ought to remind you of the folly and vice it typifies but remember, lady idris, it is not alone the once royal blood of england that colours your veins, you are a princess of austria, and every life drop is akin to emperors and kings .
no delay was to ensue .
again she looked at the ring, it was a small ruby, almost heart shaped, which she had herself given him .
the season was may, the weather stormless; we were promised a prosperous voyage .
he might remain in switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives .
it was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to villa lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood .
the sprightly parties broke up they assembled in whispering groups .
my affections were human; hope and love were the day stars of my life .
clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival, but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter frightened and astonished him .
he quickly arranged with the turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before felix could return to italy, safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely arabian, he hastened to paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law, hoping to free de lacey and agatha by this proceeding .
with an heavy heart i entered the palace, and stood fearful to advance, to speak, to look .
often all sounds were suspended, that we might listen to the nightingale, while the fire flies danced in bright measure, and the soft cooing of the aziolo spoke of fair weather to the travellers .
but, if you are seen thus strangely circumstanced, dear idris, even now your enemies may learn your flight too soon: were it not better that i hired the chaise alone?
our friend resolved however not to be foiled in his wish .
my senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty .
in a moment she was in his arms .
i dare not hope that i have inspired you with sufficient interest that the thought of me, and the affection that i shall ever bear you, will soften your melancholy and decrease the bitterness of your tears .
during our stay at naples, we often returned to this cave, sometimes alone, skimming the sun lit sea, and each time added to our store .
 ''presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but i did not understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country, which differed from that of my protectors .
the glare of flames attested the progress of destruction, while, during mingled light and obscurity, the piles around me took gigantic proportions and weird shapes .
it was spacious, and nearly circular, with a raised seat of stone, about the size of a grecian couch, at one end .
two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and was this his first crime?
a slight circumstance induced me to alter my usual route, and to return home by egham and bishopgate .
you accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature .
i leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, i am resigned to the fate awaiting me .
the christians sought their churches, christian maidens, even at the feast of roses, clad in white, with shining veils, sought, in long procession, the places consecrated to their religion, filling the air with their hymns; while, ever and anon, from the lips of some poor mourner in the crowd, a voice of wailing burst, and the rest looked up, fancying they could discern the sweeping wings of angels, who passed over the earth, lamenting the disasters about to fall on man .
but the main substance rests on the truths contained in these poetic rhapsodies, and the divine intuition which the cumaean damsel obtained from heaven .
the reproaches which agony extorted; or worse, cureless, uncomplaining depression, when his mind was sunk in a torpor, not the less painful because it was silent and moveless .
cherishing the most fervent hopes, embarked on the waste ocean, we saw with delight the receding shore of britain, and on the wings of desire outspeeded our well filled sails towards the south .
our prime festivals were held in perdita 's cottage; nor were we ever weary of talking of the past or dreaming of the future .
the vacuity his heart endured of any deep interest in life during his long absence from his native country had had a singular effect upon his ideas .
i am in a strange state of mind .
i passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which i had not seen for nearly six years .
this, i thought, was the moment of decision, which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me forever .
soon after, i entered the valley of chamounix .
the present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud .
women bear with resignation these long drawn ills, but to a man 's impatient spirit, the slow motion of our cavalcade, the melancholy repose we took at noon, the perpetual presence of the pall, gorgeous though it was, that wrapt the rifled casket which had contained raymond, the monotonous recurrence of day and night, unvaried by hope or change, all the circumstances of our march were intolerable .
besides, i wish at once to tell you my wishes and expectations, and then never again to revert to so painful a subject .
i called him my friend but i viewed all he did with jealous eyes .
when unopposed they spread their ravages wide; in cases of danger they clustered, and by dint of numbers overthrew their weak and despairing foes .
while merrival was talking, clara softly opened a door behind idris, and beckoned me to come with a gesture and look of grief .
we go on, each thought linked to the one which was its parent, each act to a previous act .
when he had landed a month ago, the noisy populace had been hushed by sorrow and fear; but this was a festival day to all .
 ''the moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened form, showed itself, while i still remained in the forest .
ashy pale, raymond and perdita sat apart, looking on with sad smiles .
our lives will not be happy, but they will be harmless and free from the misery i now feel .
 ''last thursday may th, i, my niece, and your two brothers, went to walk in plainpalais .
almost spent, as i was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense i endured for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes .
only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel .
i have resolved every night, when i am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during the day .
but this account, which might as properly belong to a former period of my life as to the present moment, leads me far afield .
i was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly i would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise .
for a moment the poor girl fancied that her mother believed that she had drank poison: she was on the point of springing up; when the countess, already at a distance from the bed, spoke in a low voice to her companion, and again idris listened:  ''hasten, '' said she,  ''there is no time to lose it is long past eleven; they will be here at five; take merely the clothes necessary for her journey, and her jewel casket . ''
this determination soothed me .
the plague was not in london alone, it was every where it came on us, as ryland had said, like a thousand packs of wolves, howling through the winter night, gaunt and fierce .
but like all other gifts of the creator to man, she is mortal; her life has attained its last hour .
we talked of change and active pursuits, but still remained at windsor, incapable of violating the charm that attached us to our secluded life .
my imagination hung upon the scene of recognition; his miniature, which i should continually wear exposed on my breast, would be the means and i imaged the moment to my mind a thousand and a thousand times, perpetually varying the circumstances .
we were all equal now; magnificent dwellings, luxurious carpets, and beds of down, were afforded to all .
i cannot rule myself .
having effected the reunion of raymond and perdita, i was eager to return to england; but his earnest request, added to awakening curiosity, and an indefinable anxiety to behold the catastrophe, now apparently at hand, in the long drawn history of grecian and turkish warfare, induced me to consent to prolong until the autumn, the period of my residence in greece .
when i found this, i resolved to quit the place that i had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants i experienced would be more easily satisfied .
but, at this period, the whole scheme of my existence was about to change .
above, the leaves of the beech wood cast a flickering shadow on his face, and waved in mournful melody over him i saw all these things and said,  ''aye, this is his grave '' and then i wept aloud, and raised my eyes to heaven to entreat for a respite to my despair and an alleviation for his unnatural suffering the tears that gushed in a warm healing stream from my eyes relieved the burthen that oppressed my heart almost to madness .
this was the first commencement of my friendship with adrian, and i must commemorate this day as the most fortunate of my life .
no distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was confused .
cursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness he could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms .
yet none of the defaced human forms which i distinguished, could be raymond; so i turned my eyes away, while my heart sickened within me .
as the images that floated before me became more distinct, i grew feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me .
a ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where i sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me .
there only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which i believed myself to possess a natural talent .
i am about to leave thee; soon this living spirit which is ever busy among strange shapes and ideas, which belong not to thee, soon it will have flown to other regions and this emaciated body will rest insensate on thy bosom   ''rolled round in earth's diurnal course with rocks, and stones, and trees .
i will put you in safety meanwhile, and return to you immediately . ''
he has frequently conversed with me on mine, which i have communicated to him without disguise .
how shall i relate the catastrophe to so much joy; but the earth would not be the earth it is covered with blight and sorrow if one such pair as these angelic creatures had been suffered to exist for one another: search through the world and you will not find the perfect happiness which their marriage would have caused them to enjoy; there must have been a revolution in the order of things as established among us miserable earth dwellers to have admitted of such consummate joy .
these feelings are transitory; each day of expectation delayed fills them with fear, and i almost dread a mutiny caused by this despair .
what do you demand of your captain?
take care of her and cherish her: one day i may claim her at your hands; but futurity is dark, make the present happy to her  . '' my father remained three months at hamburgh; when he quitted it he changed his name, my aunt could never discover that which he adopted and only by faint hints, could conjecture that he had taken the road of germany and hungary to turkey.
a woman was sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait i held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health .
i prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect, yet when i considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics, i was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success .
i broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on some other mode of action .
but it was all a dream; no eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts; i was alone .
our native oak, as his partisans called him, was visited truly by a nipping winter .
her head fell on his shoulder, she trembled, alternate changes of fire and ice ran through her limbs: observing her emotion he spoke with softened accents:  ''the blow is given .
it was now deep winter; it had snowed, and was still snowing; the wind whistled in the leafless trees, despoiling them of the white flakes as they fell; its drear moaning, and the continued knocking, mingled wildly with my dreams at length i was wide awake; hastily dressing myself, i hurried to discover the cause of this disturbance, and to open my door to the unexpected visitor .
i feel death to be near at hand and i am calm .
miracles were to be wrought in my favour, the machine of social life pushed with vast effort backward .
present her with a mirror, in which she may know herself; and, when she is an adept in that necessary but difficult science, she will wonder at her present mistake, and hasten to restore to me, what is by right mine, her forgiveness, her kind thoughts, her love . ''
we will all make it our first care, our dearest task, to contribute to your happiness . ''
after trying vainly to enter the other apartments, he perceived just within the threshold of this one, a pair of small turkish slippers; the door was ajar, but all was silent within .
less wonder far is it, that the garrison, despairing of being able to hold out longer, should take advantage of the negligence of our fleet to escape at once from siege and capture .
i have now mentioned all my studies .
they are gone for ever great as my power is i cannot recall them to you if indeed i wave my wand over you you will fancy that you feel their gentle spirits in the soft air that steals over your cheeks the distant sound of winds waters may image to you their voices which will bid you rejoice for that they live this will not take away your grief but you will shed sweeter tears than those which full of anguish hopelessness now start from your eyes this i can do also can i take you to see many of my provinces my fairy lands which you have not yet visited and whose beauty will while away the heavy time i have many lovely spots under my command which poets of old have visited and have seen those sights the relation of which has been as a revelation to the world many spots i have still in keeping of lovely fields or horrid rocks peopled by the beautiful or the tremendous which i keep in reserve for my future worshippers to one of those whose grim terrors frightened sleep from the eye i formerly led you but you now need more pleasing images although i will not promise you to shew you any new scenes yet if i lead you to one often visited by my followers you will at least see new combinations that will sooth if they do not delight you follow me alas i replied when have you found me slow to obey your voice some times indeed i have called you you have not come but when before have i not followed your slightest sign and have left what was either of joy or sorrow in our world to dwell with you in yours till you have dismissed me ever unwilling to depart but now the weight of grief that oppresses me takes from me that lightness which is necessary to follow your quick winged motions alas in the midst of my course one thought would make me droop to the ground while you would outspeed me to your kingdom of glory leave me here darkling ungrateful replied the spirit do i not tell you that i will sustain console you my wings shall aid your heavy steps i will command my winds to disperse the mist that over casts you i will lead you to a place where you will not hear laughter that disturbs you or see the sun that dazzles you we will choose some of the most sombre walks of the elysian fields the elysian fields i exclaimed with a quick scream shall i then see?
what evil might not happen in the mean time?
 ''nay, '' said my companion,  ''i can free you from your present impediment .
the rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains, so that i even saw not the faces of those mighty friends .
thus although she appeared to be less initiated in the mysteries of life and society than he her knowledge was of a deeper kind and laid on firmer foundations; and if even her beauty and sweetness had not fascinated him her understanding would ever have held his in thrall .
are these circumstances not dreadful?
yet i thank god that i have lived i thank god, that i have beheld his throne, the heavens, and earth, his footstool .
thousands died unlamented; for beside the yet warm corpse the mourner was stretched, made mute by death .
my rashness gave the victory in this dreadful fight to the enemy who triumphed over him as he lay fallen and vanquished .
again i rose, and exerting all the firmness of which i was master, removed the planks which i had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat .
look in that mirror; when i came your brow was contracted, your eyes deep sunk in your head, your lips quivering; your hands trembled violently when i took them; but now all is tranquil and soft .
  '''they are kind they are the most excellent creatures in the world; but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me .
a serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy .
he excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree .
as you honour me as you worship god, in whose image those also are created as your children and friends are dear to you, shed not a drop of precious human blood . ''
these motives urged me to comply with his demand .
the merry marriage bells rung in my ears; i heard the nation 's gratulation which followed the union; the ambitious noble uprose with swift eagle flight, from the lowly ground to regal supremacy and to the love of idris .
compassion swelled his breast; he would see her once again; he would devise some plan for restoring her to society, and the enjoyment of her rank; their separation would then follow, as a matter of course .
her mind was of uncommon strength; she could subdue her sensible wants to her mental wishes, and suffer cold, hunger and misery, rather than concede to fortune a contested point .
i beseech you; by your former love for me now lost, i adjure you to answer that one question .
 ''lionel, you hear: witness for me: persuade your sister to forgive the injury i have done her; persuade her to be mine . ''
dear victor, banish these dark passions .
if i lift up my eyes and see the desart earth, and feel that those dear eyes have spent their mortal lustre, and that those beauteous lips are silent, their   ''crimson leaves '' faded, for ever i am mute but you live, my idris, even now you move before me there was a glade, o reader a grassy opening in the wood; the retiring trees left its velvet expanse as a temple for love; the silver thames bounded it on one side, and a willow bending down dipt in the water its naiad hair, dishevelled by the wind's viewless hand .
he heard my account of the self dissolution of the army with calmness, and then said,  ''you know, verney, my fixed determination not to quit this place, until in the light of day stamboul is confessedly ours .
i doubted at first whether i should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man .
we saw a great deal of society, and no day passed that my father did not endeavour to embellish by some new enjoyment .
none had ever before suspected, that power, or the suffrage of the many, could in any manner become dear to him .
he entered the churches, and foretold to the congregations their speedy removal to the vaults below .
i know not what we are to hope; but there is some good beyond us that we must seek; and that is our earthly task .
there is something at work in my soul which i do not understand .
an old man sat in it, near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast .
she was submissive to those who held authority over her, but a perpetual cloud dwelt on her brow; she looked as if she expected enmity from every one who approached her, and her actions were instigated by the same feeling .
i, the offspring of love, the child of the woods, the nursling of nature 's bright self was to submit to this?
it was completely dark when i arrived in the environs of geneva; the gates of the town were already shut; and i was obliged to pass the night at secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city .
perdita had arrived with her child at dartford, weeping and inconsolable .
again and again i have passed over in my remembrance the different scenes of my short life: if the world is a stage and i merely an actor on it my part has been strange, and, alas tragical .
if the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind .
in his desire to repair his first losses, my father risked double stakes, and thus incurred a debt of honour he was wholly unable to pay .
 ''there is more of what is specious than true in your distinction, '' said my companion .
does not the plague rage each year in stamboul?
 ''all things go on, '' thought perdita,  ''all things proceed, decay, and perish when noontide has passed, and the weary day has driven her team to their western stalls, the fires of heaven rise from the east, moving in their accustomed path, they ascend and descend the skiey hill .
the latter feeling now predominated .
but there was no remedy .
this short seperation from his companions gave him courage to assert his independance .
but frost would come at last, and with it a renewal of our lease of earth .
raymond was actuated by far other feelings .
at first i attempted to prevent her but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed,   'o god i have murdered my darling child'  ''she fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty .
 ''it is not from deck, '' said the man at the helm,  ''something has been thrown from the aft cabin . ''
earth is to me a tomb, the firmament a vault, shrouding mere corruption .
from derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in cumberland and westmorland .
we discussed the best means of preventing infection, and of preserving health and activity in a large city thus afflicted london, for instance .
i wished to see him again, that i might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of william and justine .
oh sun how beautiful thou art and how glorious is the golden ocean that receives thee my heart is at peace i feel no sorrow a holy love stills my senses i feel as if my mind also partook of the inexpressible loveliness of surrounding nature what shall i do?
his favourite horse was found grazing by the margin of the tranquil river .
in his solitary despair adrian would often seek my sister, and in covered terms express his misery, while fortitude and agony divided the throne of his mind .
but then perdita thought more constantly of others than he; and part of her bashfulness arose from a wish to take from those around her a sense of inferiority; a feeling which never crossed her mind .
 ''i am not mad, '' i cried energetically;  ''the sun and the heavens, who have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth .
chapter iv among our most assiduous visitors was a young man of rank, well informed, and agreable in his person .
their yells were drowned in the clamour of elements, and the thunder rivings of their unwieldy habitation they discovered at last that the water gained on them, and they betook themselves to their pumps; they might as well have laboured to empty the ocean by bucketfuls .
sometimes i wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again .
she was too unlike them, too utterly alien to their tastes, for them to find delight in her society, or in the prospect of its continuance, but it gave them pleasure to see her conciliating and kind .
to be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self interest, are full of brotherly love and charity .
then i spurred on my animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all, myself or, in a more desperate fashion, i alighted and threw myself on the grass, weighed down by horror and despair .
a man of this kind was now pouring forth his eloquent despair among the inhabitants of windsor .
but when i discovered that he, the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which i was forever barred, then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance .
i was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected i had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness .
he can no longer be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable survivors . ''
what was i? the question again recurred, to be answered only with groans .
her dark hair was braided and twined in thick knots like the head dress of a grecian statue; her garb was mean, but her attitude might have been selected as a model of grace .
as soon as i perceived him i suddenly rose to escape from his observation by entering among the trees .
he listened with haughtiness, replied disdainfully; and, if in truth, she succeeded in awakening his conscience, the sole effect was that he sought an opiate for the pang in oblivious riot .
they gathered round him, counted their numbers, and detailed the reasons why they were now to receive an addition of such and such members, who had not yet declared themselves .
i saw a change in her also .
we returned again, with torches; for i could not rest, when i thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night; elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish .
my daughter, i love you '' the last words died away in a hoarse whisper, but i heard them and sunk on the ground, covering my face and almost dead with excess of sickness and fear: a cold perspiration covered my forehead and i shivered in every limb but he continued, clasping his hands with a frantic gesture:  ''now i have dashed from the top of the rock to the bottom now i have precipitated myself down the fearful chasm the danger is over; she is alive oh, mathilda, lift up those dear eyes in the light of which i live .
return speedily, lionel . ''
the cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs a dress which i have already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins .
i became intimate with him, and each day afforded me occasion to admire more and more his powerful and versatile talents, that together with his eloquence, which was graceful and witty, and his wealth now immense, caused him to be feared, loved, and hated beyond any other man in england .
poor william he was our darling and our pride  '' tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother's eyes; a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame .
the latter name made me tremble when pronounced by henry, and i hastened to quit matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated .
her face was radiant with a smile .
as i grew older books in some degree supplied the place of human intercourse: the library of my aunt was very small; shakespear, milton, pope and cowper were the strangley sic assorted poets of her collection; and among the prose authors a translation of livy and rollin 's ancient history were my chief favourites although as i emerged from childhood i found others highly interesting which i had before neglected as dull .
yet while he earnestly occupied himself about the wants of others his own desires were gratified to their fullest extent .
yet i do not pretend to account for my mood by any particular event .
when the servant came back she gave me a letter .
i was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame .
i hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which i could pursue my enemy .
i heard of the death of only sons; of wives and husbands most devoted; of the rending of ties twisted with the heart 's fibres, of friend losing friend, and young mothers mourning for their first born; and these moving incidents were grouped and painted in my mind by the knowledge of the persons, by my esteem and affection for the sufferers .
he had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young woman 's father to consent to her marriage with her lover .
there are many books which can feed the appetite craving for these things; let them turn to the accounts of boccaccio, de foe, and browne .
not a word had been spoken during the present session on any of these topics .
the peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history .
chapter vii with a beating heart and fearful, i knew not why, i dismissed the servant and locking my door, sat down to read my father 's letter .
perdita 's name was for ever joined with his; their conjugal felicity was celebrated even by the authentic testimony of facts .
it came from the room into which elizabeth had retired .
he came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself .
we resided principally in the latter, and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion .
the cup of life was poisoned forever, and although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, i saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me .
i particularly mark this night, for it was that which has hurried on the last scene of my tragedy, which else might have dwindled on through long years of listless sorrow .
he was an inferior actor, but truth now made him excellent; as he went on to announce to macduff the slaughter of his family, he was afraid to speak, trembling from apprehension of a burst of grief from the audience, not from his fellow mime .
alas i now met frowns where before i had been welcomed only with smiles: he, my beloved father, shunned me, and either treated me with harshness or a more heart breaking coldness .
but my nerveless hands can neither fell the trees, nor smooth the planks .
insatiate thirst for knowledge, and boundless affection for adrian, combined to keep both my heart and understanding occupied, and i was consequently happy .
i came to an open space a mountain of ruin in the midst, announced that some large mosque had occupied the space and here, scattered about, i saw various articles of luxury and wealth, singed, destroyed but shewing what they had been in their ruin jewels, strings of pearls, embroidered robes, rich furs, glittering tapestries, and oriental ornaments, seemed to have been collected here in a pile destined for destruction; but the rain had stopped the havoc midway .
he soon conquered my latent distaste; i endeavoured to watch him and perdita, and to keep in mind every thing i had heard to his disadvantage .
come then, no more delay, thou tardy one behold the pleasant potion look, i am a spirit of good, and not a human maid that invites thee, and with winning accents, oh, that they would win thee says, come and drink . ''
the same peculiarities of character rendered her sorrows agonies; her fancy magnified them, her sensibility made her for ever open to their renewed impression; love envenomed the heart piercing sting .
i am well acquainted with the accused .
she started up, she threw herself on his neck, she gasped and sobbed; he took her hand, and leading her to the sofa, sat down near her .
after the lovers again joined me, we supped together in the alcove .
raymond continued,  ''i will not act a part with you, dear girl, or appear other than what i am, weak and unworthy, more fit to excite your disdain than your love .
he paused, and was lost in thought .
i dismissed the guests therefore; and they went thoughtful, more than sad, to await the events in store for them .
but i was languid and many hours passed before i could reach the cottage, dragging as i did my slow steps, and often resting on the wet earth unable to proceed .
now that i am arrived at its base, my pinions are furled, the mighty stairs are before me, and step by step i must ascend the wondrous fane speak what door is opened?
we arrived at kishan on the th of july .
the cavern shape the stage assumed, the beetling rocks, the glare of the fire, the misty shades that crossed the scene at times, the music in harmony with all witch like fancies, permitted the imagination to revel, without fear of contradiction, or reproof from reason or the heart .
he looks upon study as an odious fetter; his time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the lake .
my soul is a fading spark, my nature frail as a spent wave; but i dedicate all of intellect and strength that remains to me, to that one work, and take upon me the task, as far as i am able, of bestowing blessings on my fellow men '' his voice trembled, his eyes were cast up, his hands clasped, and his fragile person was bent, as it were, with excess of emotion .
and yet i fear it; even as i fear all things; for in any state of being linked by the chain of memory with this, happiness would not return even in paradise, i must feel that your love was less enduring than the mortal beatings of my fragile heart, every pulse of which knells audibly, the funeral note of love, deep buried, without resurrection .
all was strange and admirable to the shepherd of cumberland .
oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, i now swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly .
at the commencement of summer, we began to feel, that the mischief which had taken place in distant countries was greater than we had at first suspected .
  ''you will never hear from me again: receive these then as the last words of mine that will ever reach you; and although i have forfeited your filial love, yet regard them i conjure you as a father's command .
on our side the soldiers grasped their arms firmly, and looked with stern glances on the foe .
a man might be respected with only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few and what was i? of my creation and creator i was absolutely ignorant, but i knew that i possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property .
it evidently declined, without any symptom which could lead us to suspect his disease, unless indeed his brightened eyes, animated look, and flustering cheeks, made us dread consumption; but he was without pain or fear .
the english, whether travellers or residents, came pouring in one great revulsive stream, back on their own country; and with them crowds of italians and spaniards .
how shall i ever repay you?
i would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with precipitation .
shall i create another like yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world .
a call for the boat to be lowered was echoed from the deck .
i welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial manner, and we walked towards my college .
the music died away, the shouts abruptly ended; the soldiers had cleared a space in which a carriage was drawn up .
falsehood and artifice are in themselves so hateful, that, though i still thought i did right, a feeling of shame and guilt came painfully upon me .
delighted and surprised, i embraced her, but as i imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and i thought that i held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and i saw the grave worms crawling in the folds of the flannel .
they inspired the soldiers with the same sentiment .
could i behold this and live?
i was sitting by my fire, the physician who had attended me ever since my fever had just left me, and i looked over his prescription in which digitalis was the prominent medecine .
it was to be hoped that their efforts would succeed, and that though now a prisoner, the sport of cruelty and the mark of hate, he would be rescued from danger and restored to the happiness, power, and honour which he deserved .
 ''we do also, unfortunately, '' replied my father,  ''for indeed i had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude in one i valued so highly . ''
this, proud noble, is your last night perdita has bestowed on it all of magnificent and dazzling that your heart best loves but, from these gorgeous rooms, from this princely attendance, from power and elevation, you must return with to morrow 's sun to our rural abode; for i would not buy an immortality of joy, by the endurance of one more week sister to the last .
my friend shortened the harangue, by taking the man 's torch from him; and we proceeded alone .
on the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of these was vacant when i arrived .
we travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream .
this abode of penury may at least prove the disinterestedness of my conduct .
it had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy .
 ''this is infinitely ridiculous, '' he cried,  ''if you were school boys, you could not conduct yourselves more unreasonably . ''
both then withdrew; though, as she went, the countess said,  ''softly; all sleep; though all have not been prepared for sleep, like her .
to live, according to this sense of the word, we must not only observe and learn, we must also feel; we must not be mere spectators of action, we must act; we must not describe, but be subjects of description .
once it was so; now is man lord of the creation?
i said in one of my letters, my dear margaret, that i should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet i have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, i should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart .
for alone, when no voice can disturb my dream, and no cold eye meet mine to check its fire, then i may commune with his spirit; on a lone heath, at noon or at midnight, still i should be near him .
two or three petitioners were still in attendance .
in other studies you go as far as others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder .
fortunately i had money with me .
during my first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings .
we had lived so long in the vicinity of eton, that its population of young folks was well known to us .
alas i even now look back with disgust at my artifices and contrivances by which, after many painful struggles, i effected my retreat .
stung with impatience, i urged my horse with force of spur and loosened reins down the acclivity, that, before danger could arrive, i might be at the side of my noble, godlike friend .
however it might be, neither plague nor war could prevent perdita from following her lord, or induce her to utter one objection to the plans which he proposed .
 ''then i fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice . ''
it was the height of his offending, that he should occasion in me such intolerable sensations, and not deign himself to afford any demonstration that he was aware that i even lived to feel them .
there does not exist the man in england with adequate presumption .
i, a miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment .
i was aware also that i should often lose all self command, all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation .
nor could i consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability .
idris, who entertained the highest opinion of his abilities, was warmly interested in the event: and my poor sister, who dared not hope, and to whom fear was misery, was plunged into a fever of disquietude .
she seemed to consider that through me she had lost raymond; i was the evil influence of her life; i was even accused of encreasing and confirming the mad and base apostacy of adrian from all views of advancement and grandeur; and now this miserable mountaineer was to steal her daughter .
but his fate was still uncertain; she began to fear the worst, and to feel that her soul 's hope was cast on a chance that might prove a blank .
cheer up, or i shall make you over to idris, and call adrian into the carriage, who, i see by his gesture, sympathizes with my good spirits . ''
 ''as night came on, agatha and the arabian retired early .
i threw the door forcibly open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared .
now life is all that we covet; that this automaton of flesh should, with joints and springs in order, perform its functions, that this dwelling of the soul should be capable of containing its dweller .
you may give up your purpose, but mine is assigned to me by heaven, and i dare not .
the weather during our journey had been serene .
adrian, idris and i, were established in windsor castle; lord raymond and my sister, inhabited a house which the former had built on the borders of the great park, near perdita 's cottage, as was still named the low roofed abode, where we two, poor even in hope, had each received the assurance of our felicity .
i own that i did not see her misfortune with the same eyes as perdita .
but, even though threatened by famine, her fear of the plague was paramount; and her greatest care was to avoid her fellow creatures .
i took no merit to myself for this .
 ''this is going too far, '' her mother answered, with quivering lips, and eyes again instinct by anger .
clinging, with the dastard feeling of the aged, to the remnant of her spent life, she had, on hearing that the pestilence had come into her neighbourhood, barred her door, and closed her casement, refusing to communicate with any .
he sat beside her; and, taking the paper from her hand, said,  ''not a word more shall my sweet perdita read of this contention of madmen and fools .
when love is no longer akin to hate, then brotherhood will exist: we are very far from that state at present  . ''  ''not so far as you may suppose, '' observed a little old astronomer, by name merrival,  ''the poles precede slowly, but securely; in an hundred thousand years  ''  ''we shall all be underground, '' said ryland.
her views with regard to her own children, placed all her words and actions relative to them under restraint: but evadne was a plaything she could in no way fear; nor were her talents and vivacity slight alleviations to the monotony of the countess 's life .
in the mean time, raymond had remained with adrian and idris .
we were directed to the ward where her husband had been first taken, and still was, the nurse said, if alive .
how they would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me my father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair .
i had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind .
he will feel highly honoured, and thus you may repay a part of the obligation i owe him, and compensate for the injuries fortune has done him . ''
i will say no more; for i can add nothing to what i have already said, to what you before contemptuously set aside .
little evelyn had endeavoured to draw clara away to play with him; but the italian 's tale arrested her, she crept near, her lustrous eyes fixed on the speaker .
she received my concurrence with pleasure, and a thousand times over thanked her deceiving, deceitful brother .
the concentrated pride of her nature, forgotten during her blissful dream, awoke, and with its adder 's sting pierced her heart; her humility of spirit augmented the power of the venom; she had been exalted in her own estimation, while distinguished by his love: of what worth was she, now that he thrust her from this preferment?
he snatched his hand from me, and rose in violent disorder:  ''what do you mean?
 ''come, i see that you have already cast aside the sad thoughts you before franticly indulged .
 ''your affectionate and afflicted father,  ''alphonse frankenstein .
we had our separate occupations and our common amusements .
since you left us, but one change has taken place in our little household .
we, a commercial people, were obliged to bring such schemes under consideration; and the question of contagion became matter of earnest disquisition .
now that unchanged serenity, and gentle compliance were added to her other qualifications, his respect equalled his love .
 ''yes, '' i said,  ''i see how this is, and it is strange that i should have deceived myself so long; i am about to die an innocent death, and it will be sweeter even than that which the opium promised . ''
under the influence of these melancholy thoughts, she became more than ever in love with sorrow .
but i was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life .
once, when thirteen years of age, i was sent for a month to the county jail .
i find myself, for one, as a stringed instrument with chords and stops but i have no power to turn the pegs, or pitch my thoughts to a higher or lower key . ''
i met him at the distance of thirty miles from our mansion .
henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul .
in the mean time, we, the wise of the land, will return to our castle, and, cincinnatus like, take to our usual labours, until our friend shall require our presence and assistance here . ''
such sentiments actuated our little circle .
bless thy child even even sic in death, as i bless thee; and let me sleep at peace in my quiet grave . ''
 ''let me entreat adrian, '' i cried,  ''not to comply: rather join with me in endeavouring to withdraw lord raymond from this scene, and restore him to other society . ''
chapter ix thus i passed two years .
i love my cousin tenderly and sincerely .
plague is the companion of spring, of sunshine, and plenty .
i sat on the sole remaining step of an edifice, which even in its downfall, was huge and magnificent; a few broken walls, not dislodged by gunpowder, stood in fantastic groupes, and a flame glimmered at intervals on the summit of the pile .
 ''talk not of other season than this '' he cried .
but when any whole nation becomes the victim of the destructive powers of exterior agents, then indeed man shrinks into insignificance, he feels his tenure of life insecure, his inheritance on earth cut off .
from such scenes i have sometimes saved a deserted infant sometimes led a young and grieving mother from the lifeless image of her first born, or drawn the sturdy labourer from childish weeping over his extinct family .
believe me, he was destined to be the author of infinite good to his native england .
i had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but i now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that i for the first time saw clearly .
it moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent god warring with his creatures was capable of exciting .
i feared madness, not sickness i have a presentiment that adrian will not die; perhaps this illness is a crisis, and he may recover . ''
her expressive eyes were two stars whose beams were love; hope and light heartedness sat on her cloudless brow .
when he found me a vagabond shepherd of the hills, a poacher, an unlettered savage, still his kindness did not fail .
the turkish army were at this time besieging rodosto; and the greeks, hastening their preparations, and sending each day reinforcements, were on the eve of forcing the enemy to battle .
she gazed on some flowers that stood near in a carved vase: that morning she had arranged them, they were rare and lovely plants; even now all aghast as she was, she observed their brilliant colours and starry shapes .
but let us change the subject .
but i will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee .
raymond 's beloved athenians, the free, the noble people of the divinest town in greece, fell like ripe corn before the merciless sickle of the adversary .
that same invincible monster, which hovered over and devoured constantinople that fiend more cruel than tempest, less tame than fire, is, alas, unchained in that beautiful country these reflections would not allow me to rest .
she began to count the long days, and months, and years which must elapse, before he would be restored to a private station, and unreservedly to her .
i inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information .
she had been moved from the posture in which i had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, i might have supposed her asleep .
he turned on hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable .
as at the conclusion of the eighteenth century, the english unlocked their hospitable store, for the relief of those driven from their homes by political revolution; so now they were not backward in affording aid to the victims of a more wide spreading calamity .
on the same evening, he went alone to the house named to him .
i felt as if i were recreated and had about me all the freshness and life of a new being: i was, as it were, transported since his arrival from a narrow spot of earth into a universe boundless to the imagination and the understanding .
in this house i chanced to find a volume of the works of cornelius agrippa .
he was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science .
something more was in his heart, to which he dared not give words .
you may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom i should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford .
 ''once i desired to be a king .
i shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; i shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as i have been .
chapter x it was six months after this miserable conclusion to his long nursed hopes that i first saw him .
the battle was sanguinary, the loss of the turks apparently irreparable; the greeks, in losing one man, forgot the nameless crowd strewed upon the bloody field, and they ceased to value themselves on a victory, which cost them raymond .
