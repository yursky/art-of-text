herbert west needed fresh bodies because his life work was the reanimation of the dead .
the farm like grounds extended back very deeply up the hill, almost to wheaton street .
his facial aspect, too, was remarkable for its maturity; for though he shared his mother  's and grandfather's chinlessness, his firm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression of his large, dark, almost latin eyes to give him an air of quasi adulthood and well nigh preternatural intelligence .

dr  . johnson, as i beheld him, was a full, pursy man, very ill drest, and of slovenly aspect.
i have indistinct recollections of a great storm some time after i reached the boat; at any rate, i know that i heard peals of thunder and other tones which nature utters only in her wildest moods .
there had seemed to be no one in the courtyard below, and i hoped there would be a chance to get away before the spreading of a general alarm .
nothing, however, occurred except some hill noises; and when the day came there were many who hoped that the new horror had gone as swiftly as it had come .
it was getting dark, and the ancient roofs and chimney pots outside looked very queer through the bull 's eye window panes .
again he seemed to be in the interior of a house an old house, apparently but the details and inhabitants were constantly changing, and he could never be certain of the faces or the furniture, or even of the room itself, since doors and windows seemed in just as great a state of flux as the more presumably mobile objects .
 ''and what about the window panes? ''  ''they were all gone .

ahead lay sparse grass and scrub blueberry bushes, and beyond them the naked rock of the crag and the thin peak of the dreaded grey cottage .
everyone seemed inclined to be silent now, as though holding a secret fear .

as i have said, it happened when we were in the medical school, where west had already made himself notorious through his wild theories on the nature of death and the possibility of overcoming it artificially .
a definite point among the stars had a claim on him and was calling him .

then the lean nith remarked that no one had seen the old man or his wife since the night the cats were away .
and as i looked, i beheld the head rise, the black, liquid, and deep sunken eyes open in terror, and the thin, shadowed lips part as if for a scream too frightful to be uttered .

his engagement broken, galpin moved east to begin life anew; but before long, appletonians heard of his dismissal in disgrace from new york university, where he had obtained an instructorship in english .
he had a narrow head, bulging, watery blue eyes that seemed never to wink, a flat nose, a receding forehead and chin, and singularly undeveloped ears .
only a very rare affliction, of course, could bring about such vast and radical anatomical changes in a single individual after maturity changes involving osseous factors as basic as the shape of the skull but then, even this aspect was no more baffling and unheard of than the visible features of the malady as a whole .

it was my last link with a chapter of life forever closed, and i valued it highly .
to me there was nothing grotesque in the bones and skeletons that strowed some of the stone crypts deep down among the foundations .
the thing cannot be described there is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order .
it was queer damnably queer and my uncle spoke almost sheepishly, as if half expecting not to be believed, when he declared that of the strange faces many had unmistakably borne the features of the harris family .
not any more does he long for the magic of farther hills, or sigh for secrets that peer like green reefs from a bottomless sea .
then, as i remained, paralysed with fear, he found his voice and in his dying breath screamed forth those words which have ever afterward haunted my days and my nights .
they never stopped swimmin            ' in an' aout o' the river from that cursed reef o' satan an' more an' more attic winders got a boarded up, an' more an' more noises was heerd in haouses as wa'n't s'posed to hev nobody in 'em    . . . .
at lawrence he had been prominent in the mock fraternity of  ''tappa tappa keg '', where he was the wildest and merriest of the wild and merry young roysterers; but this immature, collegiate frivolity did not satisfy him .

there were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to connecting rooms, and these i proceeded to fasten .
the professor had been stricken whilst returning from the newport boat; falling suddenly, as witnesses said, after having been jostled by a nautical looking negro who had come from one of the queer dark courts on the precipitous hillside which formed a short cut from the waterfront to the deceased 's home in williams street .
suddenly the wretch, animated with his last burst of strength, raised his hideous head from the damp and sunken pavement .

sheehan   's is the acknowledged centre to chicago's subterranean traffic in liquor and narcotics, and as such has a certain dignity which extends even to the unkempt attachés of the place; but there was until lately one who lay outside the pale of that dignity one who shared the squalor and filth, but not the importance, of sheehan's .

no recognised school of sculpture had animated this terrible object, yet centuries and even thousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish surface of unplaceable stone .
all in all, he became a disconcerting and even gruesome companion; yet in my gratitude for his healing i could not well abandon him to the strangers around him, and was careful to dust his room and attend to his needs each day, muffled in a heavy ulster which i bought especially for the purpose .
it was a lambent glow of this sort which always played about the old woman and the small furry thing in those lighter, sharper dreams which prefaced his plunge into unknown abysses, and the thought that a wakeful second person could see the dream luminance was utterly beyond sane harbourage .

when i heard the fears which had driven the people from kilderry i laughed as loudly as my friend had laughed, for these fears were of the vaguest, wildest, and most absurd character .
i had been, albeit without definite reason, instinctively on my guard and that was to my advantage in the new and real crisis, whatever it might turn out to be .
then with utter and horrifying suddenness we heard a frightful sound from below .

that scene itself must have corresponded to the sealed loft overhead, which had begun to attack his imagination so violently, but later impressions were faint and hazy .
it was plain that the owner had come home; but he had not come from the land, nor from any balloon or airship that could be imagined .
others thought and still think he 'd found an old pirate cache out on devil reef .
this is what i saw in the glass: a thin, dark man of medium stature attired in the clerical garb of the anglican church, apparently about thirty, and with rimless, steel bowed glasses glistening beneath a sallow, olive forehead of abnormal height .

as my uncle began slowly and grudgingly to unwrap the things he urged me not to be shocked by the strangeness and frequent hideousness of the designs .
as i looked, a subtle, curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion; and oddly enough, i found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression .
it is curious that although he differed so widely from the mass of hispanicised and tribal indians, romero gave not the least impression of caucasian blood .
the task seemed interminable, and i raged almost as violently as the hermit when i saw the hours slipping by in a breathless, foodless round of vain telephoning, and a hectic quest from place to place, hither and thither by subway and surface car .
who or what then, was my great great grandmother?
nor was any child to be born alive in that house for a century and a half .
then, as september approached, the clouds began to clear .
at times her screams became insupportable, and for long periods she would utter shrieking horrors which necessitated her son 's temporary residence with his cousin, peleg harris, in presbyterian lane near the new college building .
it was the pictorial carving, however, that did most to hold me spellbound .
the grave was not very deep, but fully as good as that of the previous specimen the thing which had risen of itself and uttered a sound .
the abysses were by no means vacant, being crowded with indescribably angled masses of alien hued substance, some of which appeared to be organic while others seemed inorganic .
past the churchyard, where there were no houses, i could see over the hill 's summit and watch the glimmer of stars on the harbour, though the town was invisible in the dark .
the tension on our part became very great .
you on earth have unwittingly felt its distant presence you who without knowing idly gave to its blinking beacon the name of algol, the daemon star .
again a furtive trying of a bolted connecting door, and again a receding creaking .
i was still alone, for as much as i feared the unknown horror i sought, there was more fear in the thought of telling anybody .

briden looked back and went mad, laughing shrilly as he kept on laughing at intervals till death found him one night in the cabin whilst johansen was wandering deliriously .
to this man iranon spoke, as to so many others:  ''canst thou tell me where i may find aira, the city of marble and beryl, where flows the hyaline nithra and where the falls of the tiny kra sing to verdant valleys and hills forested with yath trees? ''
in my childhood the shunned house was vacant, with barren, gnarled, and terrible old trees, long, queerly pale grass, and nightmarishly misshapen weeds in the high terraced yard where birds never lingered .
there were reasons why i would have been glad to let the war separate us; reasons why i found the practice of medicine and the companionship of west more and more irritating; but when he had gone to ottawa and through a colleague 's influence secured a medical commission as major, i could not resist the imperious persuasion of one determined that i should accompany him in my usual capacity .
geographically it lay about two miles northwest of the base of tempest mountain, and three miles from the oak girt mansion .

on his throat were the marks of murderous hands, and on his left ankle was a distressing rat bite .
thus was i left to ponder on myself as the only human creature within the great fortress, and in my utter solitude my mind began to cease its vain protest against the impending doom, to become almost reconciled to the fate which so many of my ancestors had met .
but even in this acute moment my chief horror was something apart from the immediate weakness of my defences .
trade fallin      ' off, mills losin' business even the new ones an' the best of our menfolks kilt a privateerin' in the war of or lost with the elizy brig an' the ranger snow both of 'em gilman venters .

and one, who led the way, was clad in a ghoulishly humped black coat and striped trousers, and had a man 's felt hat perched on the shapeless thing that answered for a head    . . . .
the event, under the circumstances, was tremendous; for in the existence of a subterranean space here, my mad theories had terrible confirmation .
gilman 's dreams consisted largely in plunges through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and bafflingly disordered sound; abysses whose material and gravitational properties, and whose relation to his own entity, he could not even begin to explain .
the insane yarn i had heard from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams, and i felt i must keep the image of his wild, watery eyes as far as possible from my imagination .
there was none of the exotic technique you see in sidney sime, none of the trans saturnian landscapes and lunar fungi that clark ashton smith uses to freeze the blood .

an   ' the smell was awful, like what it is araound wizard whateley's ol' haouse   . . .
on a certain rainy afternoon when this illusion seemed phenomenally strong, and when, in addition, i had fancied i glimpsed a kind of thin, yellowish, shimmering exhalation rising from the nitrous pattern toward the yawning fireplace, i spoke to my uncle about the matter .
accordingly i kept north along main to martin, then turning inland, crossing federal street safely north of the green, and entering the decayed patrician neighbourhood of northern broad, washington, lafayette, and adams streets .
in bolton the prevailing spirit of puritanism had outlawed the sport of boxing with the usual result .
yet where had the fellow got such an odd notion?
at night he would not be alone, nor would the company of a few persons calm him .
its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing, and it soon came to be the greatest influence on the town, replacing freemasonry altogether and taking up headquarters in the old masonic hall on new church green .
we both inserted the whole unopened wooden box, closed the door, and started the electricity .
his dreams were meanwhile increasing in vividness, and though shewing him none of the strange cities and incredible gardens of the old days, were assuming a definite cast whose purpose could not be mistaken .
now, as the baying of that dead, fleshless monstrosity grows louder and louder, and the stealthy whirring and flapping of those accursed web wings circles closer and closer, i shall seek with my revolver the oblivion which is my only refuge from the unnamed and unnamable .
dr  . west 's reanimated specimens were not meant for long existence or a large audience.
the old woman always appeared out of thin air near the corner where the downward slant met the inward slant .
but it was not in these vortices of complete alienage that he saw brown jenkin .
the open book lay flat between us, with the picture staring repulsively upward .
i motioned to him to continue, which he did with renewed signs of reluctance .
he was merely crass of fibre and function thoughtless, careless, and liquorish, as his easily avoidable accident proves, and without that modicum of imagination which holds the average citizen within certain limits fixed by taste .
what this meant, no one could quite be certain till later .
i was also sorry that i had no one with whom to converse .
what i saw unnerved me most surprisingly, considering its relative triviality .
i had entered the brush grown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odour again waxed dominant .
after that experience west had dropped his researches for some time; but as the zeal of the born scientist slowly returned, he again became importunate with the college faculty, pleading for the use of the dissecting room and of fresh human specimens for the work he regarded as so overwhelmingly important .
evidently the ticket agent had not exaggerated the dislike which local people bore toward innsmouth and its denizens .
then came the frenzied tones again:   ''carter, it's terrible monstrous unbelievable '' this time my voice did not fail me, and i poured into the transmitter a flood of excited questions .
and yet, as the members severally shook their heads and confessed defeat at the inspector 's problem, there was one man in that gathering who suspected a touch of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and writing, and who presently told with some diffidence of the odd trifle he knew .
and it was under a horned waning moon that i saw the city for the first time .
perhaps it is madness that is overtaking me yet perhaps a greater horror or a greater marvel is reaching out .
here, truly, was the apotheosis of the unnamable .
those who have watched the tall, lean, terrible old man in these peculiar conversations, do not watch him again .
west, young despite his marvellous scientific acquirements, had scant patience with good dr  . halsey and his erudite colleagues; and nursed an increasing resentment, coupled with a desire to prove his theories to these obtuse worthies in some striking and dramatic fashion.
some time before noon his physician, dr  . hartwell, called to see him and insisted that he cease work.
gilman could not be very clear about his reasons for this last assumption, but his haziness here was more than overbalanced by his clearness on other complex points .
the aspect of that ruin i cannot describe i must have been mad, for it seemed to rise majestic and undecayed, splendid and column cinctured, the flame reflecting marble of its entablature piercing the sky like the apex of a temple on a mountain top .
his own face was in shadow, and he wore a wide brimmed hat which somehow blended perfectly with the out of date cloak he affected; but i was subtly disquieted even before he addressed me .
it was an odd scene, and because i was strange to new england i had never known its like before .
it was a key a guide to certain gateways and transitions of which mystics have dreamed and whispered since the race was young, and which lead to freedoms and discoveries beyond the three dimensions and realms of life and matter that we know .
as the hour for its arrival drew near i noticed a general drift of the loungers to other places up the street, or to the ideal lunch across the square .
it seems to me rather merciful that i do not, for they were terrible studies, which i pursued more through reluctant fascination than through actual inclination .
all made o  ' squirmin' ropes    . . .
looking about, i saw that the ceiling was wet and dripping; the soaking apparently proceeding from a corner on the side toward the street .
one afternoon there was a discussion of possible freakish curvatures in space, and of theoretical points of approach or even contact between our part of the cosmos and various other regions as distant as the farthest stars or the trans galactic gulfs themselves or even as fabulously remote as the tentatively conceivable cosmic units beyond the whole einsteinian space time continuum .
certainly it sounds absurd to hear that a woman educated only in the rudiments of french often shouted for hours in a coarse and idiomatic form of that language, or that the same person, alone and guarded, complained wildly of a staring thing which bit and chewed at her .
men have felt the tears of the gods on white capped thurai, though they have thought it rain; and have heard the sighs of the gods in the plaintive dawn winds of lerion .
besides, the body would not be even approximately fresh the next night .
gilman mechanically attended classes that morning, but was wholly unable to fix his mind on his studies .

a paralysis of fear stifled all attempts to cry out .
then one night when the moon was full the travellers came to a mountain crest and looked down upon the myriad lights of oonai .
we expelled the bodies through the double hatches and were alone in the u  .
when, to agree with him, i said i was distrustful of the authenticity of ossian 's ms, mr  . johnson said:  ''that, sir, does not do your understanding particular credit; for what all the town is sensible of, is no great discovery for a grub street critick to make.
back bay isn   't boston it isn't anything yet, because it's had no time to pick up memories and attract local spirits .
especially was he afraid to be out of doors alone when the stars were shining, and if forced to this condition he would often glance furtively at the sky as if hunted by some monstrous thing therein .
as the afternoon advanced, it became increasingly difficult to see; and we heard the rumble of a thunderstorm gathering over tempest mountain .
my preference would be to avoid paine, since the fire station there might be open all night .
chords, vibrations, and harmonic ecstasies echoed passionately on every hand; while on my ravished sight burst the stupendous spectacle of ultimate beauty .
and the roof is of pure gold, set upon tall pillars of ruby and azure, and having such carven figures of gods and heroes that he who looks up to those heights seems to gaze upon the living olympus .
the place was avoided with doubled assiduousness, and invested with every whispered myth tradition could supply .
it seems that on that last hideous night joe had stooped to look at the crimson rat tracks which led from gilman 's couch to the nearby hole .
for without warning, in one of the small hours beyond midnight, all the ravages of the years and the storms and the worms came to a tremendous climax; and after the crash there was nothing left standing in the street save two ancient chimneys and part of a stout brick wall .
it was, the belgian averred, a most extraordinary object; an object quite beyond the power of a layman to classify .
i did not like the way he looked at healthy living bodies; and then there came a nightmarish session in the cellar laboratory when i learned that a certain specimen had been a living body when he secured it .
i said it at first and i say it still, and i never swerved an inch, either, when he shewed that  ''ghoul feeding '' .
whilst they strove to strip from life its embroidered robes of myth, and to shew in naked ugliness the foul thing that is reality, kuranes sought for beauty alone .
unwholesome recollections of things in the necronomicon and the black book welled up, and he found himself swaying to infandous rhythms said to pertain to the blackest ceremonies of the sabbat and to have an origin outside the time and space we comprehend .
all denied a part in the ritual murders, and averred that the killing had been done by black winged ones which had come to them from their immemorial meeting place in the haunted wood .
they were that kind the old lattice windows that went out of use before  .
the bones of the tiny paws, it is rumoured, imply prehensile characteristics more typical of a diminutive monkey than of a rat; while the small skull with its savage yellow fangs is of the utmost anomalousness, appearing from certain angles like a miniature, monstrously degraded parody of a human skull .
morbid art doesn 't shock me, and when a man has the genius pickman had i feel it an honour to know him, no matter what direction his work takes .
from those blurred and fragmentary memories we may infer much, yet prove little .
of my exact age, even down to days and hours, i kept a most careful record, for each movement of the pendulum of the massive clock in the library told off so much more of my doomed existence .
at first it told to me only the plain little tales of calm beaches and near ports, but with the years it grew more friendly and spoke of other things; of things more strange and more distant in space and in time .
now, he reflected, those nervous fears were being mirrored in his disordered dreams .
open up the gates to yog sothoth with the long chant that ye  'll find on page of the complete edition, an' then put a match to the prison .

my host now took my hand to draw me to one of the two windows on the long side of the malodorous room, and at the first touch of his ungloved fingers i turned cold .

yog sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate .
when exceptions did occur, they were mostly persons with no trace of aberrancy, like the old clerk at the hotel .

it was he who had given me all the information i had of tillinghast after i was repulsed in rage .
when gilman climbed up a ladder to the cobwebbed level loft above the rest of the attic he found vestiges of a bygone aperture tightly and heavily covered with ancient planking and secured by the stout wooden pegs common in colonial carpentry .
many were the waterfalls in their courses, and many were the lilied lakelets into which they expanded .
nor could i ever after see the world as i had known it .
in the deeper dreams everything was likewise more distinct, and gilman felt that the twilight abysses around him were those of the fourth dimension .
they talked of their illustrious tyrant, and of the splendour of his capital; and exulted in the glory of the statue which musides had wrought for him .

i neither knew nor cared whether my experience was insanity, dreaming, or magic; but was determined to gaze on brilliance and gaiety at any cost .
i stopped automatically, though lacking the brain to retreat .
the scenery, judged by any ordinary aesthetic canon, is more than commonly beautiful; yet there is no influx of artists or summer tourists .
he was wholly alone, and his first act was to walk to the balustrade and look dizzily down at the endless, cyclopean city almost two thousand feet below .
those who had lacked something lacked it no longer, yet did fear and hatred and ignorance still brood over the street; for many had stayed behind, and many strangers had come from distant places to the ancient houses .
this i perceived with unhealthy sharpness despite the fact that two of my other senses were violently assailed .

as the weeks passed, the playing grew wilder, whilst the old musician acquired an increasing haggardness and furtiveness pitiful to behold .
in short, both principle and policy demanded stern action; and i could not doubt but that publius scribonius, bearing in mind the dignity and obligations of the roman people, would adhere to his plan of despatching the cohort, me accompanying, despite such objections as balbutius and asellius speaking indeed more like provincials than romans might see fit to offer and multiply .

not far from the grey city of ib did the wandering tribes lay the first stones of sarnath, and at the beings of ib they marvelled greatly .

whilst barzai was shouting these things atal felt a spectral change in the air, as if the laws of earth were bowing to greater laws; for though the way was steeper than ever, the upward path was now grown fearsomely easy, and the bulging cliff proved scarce an obstacle when he reached it and slid perilously up its convex face .

the things we saw were very old and marvellous, or at least they seemed so in the few straggling rays of light by which i viewed them, and i shall never forget the tottering ionic columns and fluted pilasters and urn headed iron fence posts and flaring lintelled windows and decorative fanlights that appeared to grow quainter and stranger the deeper we advanced into this inexhaustible maze of unknown antiquity .

we often cast a beam around the ship, but saw only dolphins, swimming parallel to our own drifting course .
and, as i have implied, it was not of the dead man himself that i became afraid .
warped and bigoted with preconceived illusions of justice, freedom, and consistency, they cast off the old lore and the old ways with the old beliefs; nor ever stopped to think that that lore and those ways were the sole makers of their present thoughts and judgments, and the sole guides and standards in a meaningless universe without fixed aims or stable points of reference .

i have said that i awaked suddenly and in alarm .
but when the moon went over to the west and the still tide ebbed from the sullen shore, i saw in that light old spires that the waves almost uncovered, and white columns gay with festoons of green seaweed .
the place was far from any road, and in sight of no other house, yet precautions were none the less necessary; since rumours of strange lights, started by chance nocturnal roamers, would soon bring disaster on our enterprise .
there was nothing like a ladder in the tomb, and the coffin niches on the sides and rear which birch seldom took the trouble to use afforded no ascent to the space above the door .

what i did succeed in doing was to overhear the nocturnal playing of the dumb old man .
about , when wilbur was a boy of ten whose mind, voice, stature, and bearded face gave all the impressions of maturity, a second great siege of carpentry went on at the old house .

it had been an eldritch thing no wonder sensitive students shudder at the puritan age in massachusetts .
he would have descended and asked the way to ooth nargai had not a fearsome aurora sputtered up from some remote place beyond the horizon, shewing the ruin and antiquity of the city, and the stagnation of the reedy river, and the death lying upon that land, as it had lain since king kynaratholis came home from his conquests to find the vengeance of the gods .
the press cuttings, as i have intimated, touched on cases of panic, mania, and eccentricity during the given period .
they glistened bloated and green in the moonbeams, and seemed to gaze up at the fount of light .
my immediate actions were peculiar for such a situation, but it is only in tales that a man does the dramatic and foreseen thing .
here the dense growth of weeds and briers hindered me and cruelly tore my clothes, but i was none the less glad that they were there to give me concealment in case of peril .
there was talk of a complaint to the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals; but nothing ever came of it, since dunwich folk are never anxious to call the outside world 's attention to themselves .
we chose our house with the greatest care, seizing at last on a rather run down cottage near the end of pond street; five numbers from the closest neighbour, and separated from the local potter 's field by only a stretch of meadow land, bisected by a narrow neck of the rather dense forest which lies to the north .
i now visited the accursed place with increased frequency; studying the unwholesome vegetation of the garden, examining all the walls of the building, and poring over every inch of the earthen cellar floor .

i believe i did ridiculous things such as offering prayers to artemis, latona, demeter, persephone, and plouton .
they insisted that this was kingsport, and i could not deny it .
the newcomer was a thin, dark man of medium height attired in the clerical garb of the anglican church .
the smell of the sea took on ominous implications, and the silent driver 's bent, rigid back and narrow head became more and more hateful .

william harris, at last thoroughly convinced of the radically unhealthful nature of his abode, now took steps toward quitting it and closing it forever .
it wearied carter to see how solemnly people tried to make earthly reality out of old myths which every step of their boasted science confuted, and this misplaced seriousness killed the attachment he might have kept for the ancient creeds had they been content to offer the sonorous rites and emotional outlets in their true guise of ethereal fantasy .
i cannot express the wild, breathless suspense with which we waited for results on this first really fresh specimen the first we could reasonably expect to open its lips in rational speech, perhaps to tell of what it had seen beyond the unfathomable abyss .
he sometimes dreamed better when awake, and he wanted to use that key .

i had, i felt, been halted by a barrier which my friend and leader had successfully passed .
after the beams came clouds, and then i slept .
the villagers of hatheg say it is ill to climb hatheg kla at any time, and deadly to climb it by night when pale vapours hide the summit and the moon; but barzai heeded them not when he came from neighbouring ulthar with the young priest atal, who was his disciple .
apparently the horror had descended by a route much the same as that of its ascent .
relieved of my seizure in a marvellously short while, i left the shivery place a disciple and devotee of the gifted recluse .
only an effort halted him at a cafeteria in church street, and after the meal he felt the unknown pull still more strongly .
for some unknown reason i dreaded the thought of disturbing the ancient bog and its sunless secrets, and pictured terrible sights lying black under the unmeasured depth of age old peat .
on account of the general alarm and precautions, there were only two more victims, and the capture was effected without major casualties .
it was in the dark of september th that the horror broke loose .
there were vague statements about disease and concentration camps, and later about dispersal in various naval and military prisons, but nothing positive ever developed .
on reflection, he was glad he had not consulted the still more inquisitive college doctor .
barzai knew so much of the gods that he could tell of their comings and goings, and guessed so many of their secrets that he was deemed half a god himself .
others   'll worship with us at meetin' time, an' sarten haouses hez got to entertain guests    . . .
we did not descend far, and when after several hours the sea was calmer, we decided to return to the surface .
he had thought he heard rats in the partitions all the evening, but paid little attention to them .
it appeared that i was a provincial quæstor named l   . cælius rufus, and that i had been summoned by the proconsul, p. scribonius libo, who had come from tarraco some days before.
i admired his clearness and persistence, and added some further revelations i had collected among the old people .
   ''let me see, trever, '' continued the defaulter,  ''didn't schultz say your mother is a literary person, too? ''  ''yes, damn it, '' replied trever,  ''but nothing like the old teian she's one of those dull, eternal moralisers that try to take all the joy out of life .
the terror which brought me to the scene was a sudden and portentous confirmation of the mountaineers ' wildest legends .
on the third day slater was found unconscious in the hollow of a tree, and taken to the nearest gaol; where alienists from albany examined him as soon as his senses returned .
somewhere, to what remote and fearsome region i know not, denys barry has gone .
my mind, as alert as my senses, recognised the gravely unusual; and almost automatically i leaped up and turned about to grasp the destructive instruments which we had left trained on the mouldy spot before the fireplace .
that the influence of the old house was unwholesome, he could not deny; but traces of his early morbid interest still held him there .
they say there is no land of lomar, save in my nocturnal imaginings; that in those realms where the pole star shines high and red aldebaran crawls low around the horizon, there has been naught save ice and snow for thousands of years, and never a man save squat yellow creatures, blighted by the cold, whom they call  ''esquimaux '' .
degraded and ignorant as they were, the creatures held with surprising consistency to the central idea of their loathsome faith .
of the name and abode of this man but little is written, for they were of the waking world only; yet it is said that both were obscure .
some said the thunder called the lurking fear out of its habitation, while others said the thunder was its voice .
i hear a noise at the door, as of some immense slippery body lumbering against it .
his oddities certainly did not look asiatic, polynesian, levantine, or negroid, yet i could see why the people found him alien .
as i hurried home through those narrow, winding, mist choked waterfront streets i had a frightful impression of being stealthily followed by softly padding feet .
that at least two of the fear 's embodiments were destroyed, formed but a slight guarantee of mental and physical safety in this acheron of multiform diabolism; yet i continued my quest with even greater zeal as events and revelations became more monstrous .
it was not a strong or even a fairly strong light; certainly not nearly strong enough to read an average book by .
only his tendency toward a dazed stupor prevented him from screaming aloud .
i am an entity like that which you yourself become in the freedom of dreamless sleep .
it was more horrible than anything i had ever overheard, because i could now see the expression of his face, and could realise that this time the motive was stark fear .
he had heard, meanwhile, of whateley 's grotesque trip to cambridge, and of his frantic efforts to borrow or copy from the necronomicon at the widener library .
early risers on the th noticed a peculiar stench in the air .
in the midst of these reflections, as if dramatically arranged to intensify them, there fell near by a terrific bolt of lightning followed by the sound of sliding earth .
i hated the mocking moon, the hypocritical plain, the festering mountain, and those sinister mounds .
reading the life of theseus, i was much impressed by that passage telling of the great stone beneath which the boyish hero was to find his tokens of destiny whenever he should become old enough to lift its enormous weight .
those old ones were gone now, inside the earth and under the sea; but their dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to the first men, who formed a cult which had never died .
and there were cobblestones over which clattered many a blooded horse and rumbled many a gilded coach; and brick sidewalks with horse blocks and hitching posts .
the more he remembered of his hideous dream the more terrified he felt, and it added to his desperation to hear joe mazurewicz chanting mournfully two floors below .
sometimes he would take walks through shadowy tangles of unpaved musty smelling lanes where eldritch brown houses of unknown age leaned and tottered and leered mockingly through narrow, small paned windows .
i did, however, improve my stay in arkham by collecting some genealogical notes i had long wished to possess; very rough and hasty data, it is true, but capable of good use later on when i might have time to collate and codify them .
messrs  . ricci, czanek, and silva selected the night of april th for their call.
the rue d 'auseil lay across a dark river bordered by precipitous brick blear windowed warehouses and spanned by a ponderous bridge of dark stone .
when i see this i telled eb holt,        'that's suthin' ta stir ye up an' make yer blood tickle' when i read in scripter about slayin' like them midianites was slew i kinder think things, but i ain't got no picter of it .
the really inexplicable thing was the way in which the victims ignorant people, for the ill smelling and widely shunned house could now be rented to no others would babble maledictions in french, a language they could not possibly have studied to any extent .
i remember the night i made the five concentric circles of fire on the floor, and stood in the innermost one chanting that monstrous litany the messenger from tartary had brought .
meanwhile joyful servants were proclaiming the finding of young godfrey in a distant and unused chamber of the great edifice, telling too late that poor michel had been killed in vain .
and yet i saw them in a limitless stream flopping, hopping, croaking, bleating surging inhumanly through the spectral moonlight in a grotesque, malignant saraband of fantastic nightmare .
north of the river there were traces of squalid life active fish packing houses in water street, smoking chimneys and patched roofs here and there, occasional sounds from indeterminate sources, and infrequent shambling forms in the dismal streets and unpaved lanes but i seemed to find this even more oppressive than the southerly desertion .
the picture was very vivid for a while, but gradually gave way to a more horrible conception; that of utter, absolute solitude in infinite, sightless, soundless space .
the next day, it appears, they raised and landed on a small island, although none is known to exist in that part of the ocean; and six of the men somehow died ashore, though johansen is queerly reticent about this part of his story, and speaks only of their falling into a rock chasm .
only old zebulon, who was not with the group, could have done justice to the situation or suggested a plausible explanation .
they filed a ponderous report at the court house in aylesbury, and litigations concerning heirship are said to be still in progress amongst the innumerable whateleys, decayed and undecayed, of the upper miskatonic valley .
it was from these that i determined to choose a colleague, and the more i reflected the more my preference inclined toward one arthur munroe, a dark, lean man of about thirty five, whose education, taste, intelligence, and temperament all seemed to mark him as one not bound to conventional ideas and experiences .
but of what followed, and of the reason i was found alone and dazed on the edge of the swamp next morning, i must insist that i know nothing save what i have told you over and over again .
he would often awake calling for his mother and grandfather, both in their graves a quarter of a century .
i told them of the vault, and they pointed to the unbroken plaster wall and laughed .
at three o 'clock he took some lunch at a restaurant, noting meanwhile that the pull had either lessened or divided itself .
the whippoorwills were piping wildly, and in a singularly curious irregular rhythm quite unlike that of the visible ritual .
this fusion of dream and reality was too much to bear .
in she fell victim to a mild form of insanity, and was thereafter confined to the upper part of the house; her elder maiden sister, mercy dexter, having moved in to take charge of the family .
he talked of death incessantly, but laughed hollowly when such things as burial or funeral arrangements were gently suggested .
the villagers did not know how much to believe from so small a boy; and though they feared that the evil pair had charmed the cats to their death, they preferred not to chide the old cotter till they met him outside his dark and repellent yard .
it is still spectral, but its strangeness fascinates me, and i shall find mixed with my relief a queer regret when it is torn down to make way for a tawdry shop or vulgar apartment building .
reason, logic, and normal ideas of motivation stood confounded .
for three days they climbed higher, higher, and higher toward the roof of the world; then they camped to wait for the clouding of the moon .
aunt martha was in the doorway, and did not scold too hard when benijah shoved the truant in .
probably they traded in arkham, knowing how little kingsport liked their habitation, or perhaps being unable to climb down the cliff on the kingsport side .
rome and ravenna are rivals for the honour of his birth, though it is certain that he received his rhetorical and philosophical training in the schools of athens the extent of whose suppression by theodosius a century before is grossly exaggerated by the superficial .
men of learning suspect it little, and ignore it mostly .
of this he had been assured by frank elwood, the one fellow student whose poverty forced him to room in this squalid and unpopular house .
as the weeks passed, i observed with regret that my new friend was indeed slowly but unmistakably losing ground physically, as mrs  . herrero had suggested.
then, with a dazed automatism which persisted despite hopelessness, i made for the next connecting door and performed the blind motion of pushing at it in an effort to get through and granting that fastenings might be as providentially intact as in this second room bolt the hall door beyond before the lock could be turned from outside .
shall i say that the voice was deep; hollow; gelatinous; remote; unearthly; inhuman; disembodied?
he read avidly by himself now; but talked much less than formerly .
finally the air grew thin, and the sky changed colour, and the climbers found it hard to breathe; but still they toiled up and up, marvelling at the strangeness of the scene and thrilling at the thought of what would happen on the summit when the moon was out and the pale vapours spread around .
so taking the solitary acetylene lamp into the adjacent laboratory, we left our silent guest on the slab in the dark, and bent every energy to the mixing of a new solution; the weighing and measuring supervised by west with an almost fanatical care .
at last came that which i had long feared .
but before his resolution was put to the test, the unexpected intervened .
she had found it in the young gentleman 's bed on the side next the wall .
what was it that had enmeshed him?
many things had taught them secretiveness, and there was now no need to exert pressure on them .
though the hands of its clock were missing on the side i glimpsed, i knew that those hoarse strokes were telling the hour of eleven .
all of these, however, bore out the notes in full .
professor upham especially liked his demonstration of the kinship of higher mathematics to certain phases of magical lore transmitted down the ages from an ineffable antiquity human or pre human whose knowledge of the cosmos and its laws was greater than ours .
like and yet unlike, for there was in the eyes of all a weird, unhealthy glitter as of greed, ambition, vindictiveness, or misguided zeal .
to seek to describe it were useless for it was such that no description is possible .
 ''everybody was in a bad way them days .
here the strangers had been granted a haven; and the swarthy etienne roulet, less apt at agriculture than at reading queer books and drawing queer diagrams, was given a clerical post in the warehouse at pardon tillinghast 's wharf, far south in town street .
but still these shadows of my dream deride me .
one september day an unexpected glimpse of him induced an epileptic fit in a man who had come to repair his electric desk lamp; a fit for which he prescribed effectively whilst keeping himself well out of sight .
so without delay west had injected into the body 's wrist the compound which would hold it fresh for use after my arrival .
everybody shrieked when a large rat like form suddenly jumped out from beneath the ensanguined bedclothes and scuttled across the floor to a fresh, open hole close by .
it is perhaps worth mentioning that i was not at all surprised or terrified on learning of the nature of the vault .
then he saw the old woman and the small furry thing advancing toward him over the carpeted floor .
there was a suggestion of sound, too, though the wind was blowing the other way a suggestion of bestial scraping and bellowing even worse than the muttering of the parties i had lately overheard .
i, a german, should be the first to tread those aeon forgotten ways i produced and examined a deep sea diving suit of joined metal, and experimented with the portable light and air regenerator .
for the cat is cryptic, and close to strange things which men cannot see .
the far corners were all shadows, and the whole place took on a hazy unreality which obscured its nature and invited the imagination to symbolism and phantasm .
he was, in fine, made sensible that all the world is but the smoke of our intellects; past the bidding of the vulgar, but by the wise to be puffed out and drawn in like any cloud of prime virginia tobacco .
ironic humour dragged down all the twilight minarets he reared, and the earthy fear of improbability blasted all the delicate and amazing flowers in his faery gardens .
west and i were doing post graduate work in summer classes at the medical school of miskatonic university, and my friend had attained a wide notoriety because of his experiments leading toward the revivification of the dead .
honest, wholesome structures do not stare at travellers so slyly and hauntingly, and in my genealogical researches i had encountered legends of a century before which biassed me against places of this kind .
my eyes, however, never turned away from the horrible opening at the base of the chimney; and i began to get glimpses of the crumbling bricks and unhealthy weeds as faint glows of lightning penetrated the woods outside and illumined the chinks in the upper wall .
far into the night they discussed, and the next day was a whirlwind of preparation on the part of them all .
at the time, indeed, my attention was distracted from this matter by another phenomenon; a phenomenon so fleeting that i could not take oath upon its reality .
i climbed gentle hills from whose summits i could see entrancing panoramas of loveliness, with steepled towns nestling in verdant valleys, and with the golden domes of gigantic cities glittering on the infinitely distant horizon .
and on the thirty first day that we followed the bird, we beheld the basalt pillars of the west .
the marsh still glittered beyond, but in the farther distance i saw the steeples of what was then all of new york; trinity and st  . paul 's and the brick church dominating their sisters, and a faint haze of wood smoke hovering over the whole.
you say to me that there is nothing in the swamp or near it which could form the setting of that frightful episode .
the light was not white but violet, and seemed less like true light than like some radio active bombardment .
then there came a subdued sort of clatter which somehow set me all in gooseflesh a furtive, groping kind of clatter, though i can 't attempt to convey what i mean in words .
at last i could feel a real shiver run through manton, who had moved very near .
my programme, i decided, would be to thread the principal streets, talk with any non natives i might encounter, and catch the eight o 'clock coach for arkham .
always an ice cold intellectual machine; slight, blond, blue eyed, and spectacled; i think he secretly sneered at my occasional martial enthusiasms and censures of supine neutrality .
brown jenkin, tough of sinew and with four tiny hands of daemoniac dexterity, had been busy while the witch was throttling him, and his efforts had been in vain .
in this fearless explorer had been placed in a madhouse at huntingdon .
but the villagers did not discuss such things with the old man and his wife; because of the habitual expression on the withered faces of the two, and because their cottage was so small and so darkly hidden under spreading oaks at the back of a neglected yard .
as i stood pondering with my hand on the now useless switch i heard a muffled creaking on the floor below, and thought i could barely distinguish voices in conversation .
 ''oh, thet afriky book?
there it still stood on the night i dug in jan martense 's grave .
in the evening barry dined with me and announced that he would begin the drainage in two days .
as he listened he thought a rhythmic confusion of faint musical pipings covering a wide tonal range welled up from the narrow streets beneath, and he wished he might discern the denizens of the place .
his feet were indistinguishable because of the table and bench, but he must have been shod, since there was a clicking whenever he changed position .
all this, to the pious miss tilton, formed an excellent reason for shunning the ancient town of decay and desolation; but to me it was merely a fresh incentive .
just as the building was wiped out by a german shell, there had been a success .
and it was by moonlight that we anchored at last in the harbour of sona nyl, which is guarded by twin headlands of crystal that rise from the sea and meet in a resplendent arch .
on the floor were confused muddy prints, but oddly enough they did not extend all the way to the door .
alone i mounted the tower, for every man of stout body was needed in the passes below .
but as leaving time obviously approached i conquered my qualms and followed the man aboard, extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single word  ''innsmouth '' .
seized with a gloomy and fanatical belief which exiled them from their kind, their ancestors sought the wilderness for freedom .
in his dream delirium gilman heard the hellish, alien rhythmed chant of the sabbat coming from an infinite distance, and knew the black man must be there .
a struggle, a needle, and a powerful alkaloid had transformed it to a very fresh corpse, and the experiment had succeeded for a brief and memorable moment; but west had emerged with a soul calloused and seared, and a hardened eye which sometimes glanced with a kind of hideous and calculating appraisal at men of especially sensitive brain and especially vigorous physique .
the building was full of a frightful stench which dr  . armitage knew too well, and the three men rushed across the hall to the small genealogical reading room whence the low whining came.
but alfred trever did not speak the truth, as many guessed when he offered to take charge of the body and secure its interment in appleton .
before i had protested at his unnatural pryings into the unthinkable; now that he had evidently succeeded to some degree i almost shared his spirit, terrible though the cost of victory appeared .
he now refused to admit me at any time, and shunned me whenever we met on the stairs .
here we were comparatively calm, despite a somewhat puzzling southward current which we could not identify from our oceanographic charts .
i can see him now as he was then and i shiver .
from beyond came a glow that weirdly lit the giant twisted trees and the tops of the buried temples, and i drifted on songfully, expectant of the glories of the land from whence i should never return .
a very thin sprinkling of repellent looking youngish people now became visible on the sidewalks lone individuals, and silent knots of two or three .
but i might not be mad if those accursed tomb legions had not been so silent .
a couple o  ' weeks later, when nothin' had ben throwed into the sea fer that long   . . .
and yet i could extract nothing definite from the man .
even now he could detect a low, monstrous shaking whose tempo he suspected all too well .
upon that sea the hateful moon shone, and over its unvocal waves weird perfumes brooded .
and golden flames played about weedy locks, so that olney was dazzled as he did them homage .
it was to a time battered edifice of this description that i was driven one afternoon in november, , by a rain of such chilling copiousness that any shelter was preferable to exposure .
them as was born more like the things changed arly, but them as was nearly human sometimes stayed on the island till they was past seventy, though they 'd usually go daown under fer trial trips afore that .
as i considered the inevitable end my mind ran over preceding events, and developed a hitherto dormant impression which would have caused a weaker and more superstitious man to shudder .
and as i looked upon the little gate in the mighty wall, i felt that beyond it lay a dream country from which, once it was entered, there would be no return .
my uncle, it seems, had quickly instituted a prodigiously far flung body of inquiries amongst nearly all the friends whom he could question without impertinence, asking for nightly reports of their dreams, and the dates of any notable visions for some time past .
the deep ones could never be destroyed, even though the palaeogean magic of the forgotten old ones might sometimes check them .
he did not walk or climb, fly or swim, crawl or wriggle; yet always experienced a mode of motion partly voluntary and partly involuntary .
yet i had read only the least fragment of that blasphemous rune before closing the book and bringing it away .
sometimes, in the throes of a nightmare when unseen powers whirl one over the roofs of strange dead cities toward the grinning chasm of nis, it is a relief and even a delight to shriek wildly and throw oneself voluntarily along with the hideous vortex of dream doom into whatever bottomless gulf may yawn .
apparently it was a point somewhere between hydra and argo navis, and he knew that he had been urged toward it ever since he had awaked soon after dawn .
one other thing is curious .
louder and louder, wilder and wilder, mounted the shrieking and whining of that desperate viol .
having taken the fortified places at the foot of the mountains, their way now lay open to the plateau, unless every citizen could resist with the strength of ten men .
methought its spirit whispered evil counsel, soothing me to traitorous somnolence with a damnable rhythmical promise which it repeated over and over:   ''slumber, watcher, till the spheres six and twenty thousand years have revolv'd, and i return to the spot where now i burn .
one might easily imagine an alien nucleus of substance or energy, formless or otherwise, kept alive by imperceptible or immaterial subtractions from the life force or bodily tissues and fluids of other and more palpably living things into which it penetrates and with whose fabric it sometimes completely merges itself .
people sometimes heard the queerest kind of sounds .
the trail up and down sentinel hill seemed to armitage of almost cataclysmic significance, and he looked long at the sinister altar like stone on the summit .
for the moment his recollections were hopelessly hazy, but he knew at least that he must have been sleep walking .
i was not alone, for foolhardiness was not then mixed with that love of the grotesque and the terrible which has made my career a series of quests for strange horrors in literature and in life .
it was he who wisely advised the burgesses of ulthar when they passed their remarkable law against the slaying of cats, and who first told the young priest atal where it is that black cats go at midnight on st  . john 's eve.
in the spring after wilbur 's birth lavinia resumed her customary rambles in the hills, bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy child .
klenze had gone mad and perished before reaching this sinister remnant of a past unwholesomely remote, and had advised me to go with him .
wudn  't bother no strangers as might bear tales aoutside that is, withaout they got pryin' .
i wondered for a moment what the strange affliction of this man might be, and whether his obstinate refusal of outside aid were not the result of a rather baseless eccentricity .
but business is business, and to a robber whose soul is in his profession, there is a lure and a challenge about a very old and very feeble man who has no account at the bank, and who pays for his few necessities at the village store with spanish gold and silver minted two centuries ago .
he had not mentioned this before, but now he must tell about it because it meant that keziah and her long toothed familiar were haunting the young gentleman .
but it was lonely among strangers, so barry had asked me to come .
in the sunshine of the morning the proxenoi led the tyrant 's messengers up the slope to the abode of the sculptor, but the night wind had done strange things .
one case, which the note describes with emphasis, was very sad .
it was the terrible season of the autumn, and the wild people in the mountains were preparing for the frightful ceremonies which only rumour told of in the towns .
the first comer now went to a cupboard on the inner side of the room and extracted a coil of rope .
within twenty four hours the stranger had become so bright that it outshone capella .
from some farmhouse far away came the frantic barking of dogs .
he had been found covered with blood and shreds of flesh in a wood, shortly after the killing and rending of a boy by a pair of wolves .
i tried to raise my hand to shut out the sight, yet so stunned were my nerves that my arm could not fully obey my will .
and the mists of the dawn are thicker, and sailors are not quite so sure that all the muffled seaward ringing is that of the solemn buoys .
dangers he met unflinchingly; crimes he committed unmoved .
i had often heard of this work, with its curious illustrations by the brothers de bry, hence for a moment forgot my uneasiness in my desire to turn the pages before me .
at the end of the corridor was a bathroom a discouraging relique with ancient marble bowl, tin tub, faint electric light, and musty wooden panelling around all the plumbing fixtures .
morning came wanly, and the night sounds ceased .
and he gazed also upon mount aran rising regally from the shore, its lower slopes green with swaying trees and its white summit touching the sky .
i did not like those rumours of a fight which were floating about .
had i not a right to rest till eternity amongst the descendants of sir geoffrey hyde?
disintegration is quite painless, i assure you but i want you to see them .
before carter awaked, the gentle visitant had told him where to find that box; that carved oak box of archaic wonder whose grotesque lid no hand had raised for two centuries .
also, dombrowski must attend to the poisoning of those rats in the walls .
then i saw the lurid shimmering of pale light, and heard the insidious lapping of sunless waters .
this ancient confirmed every tale which jermyn had heard, adding his own account of the stone city and the white apes as it had been told to him .
sleep seized me quickly, and i was at once haunted with dreams of the most disturbing kind .
the patterns all hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable abysses in time and space, and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister .
one detail that annoyed me was the distribution of the few faint sounds i heard .
the change, it was said, came simultaneously with the innsmouth epidemic of , and was thought by simple folk to have a dark connexion with hidden forces of evil .
johansen and his men landed at a sloping mud bank on this monstrous acropolis, and clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which could have been no mortal staircase .
birch, being by temperament phlegmatic and practical, did not shout long; but proceeded to grope about for some tools which he recalled seeing in a corner of the tomb .
and the young men who had returned dwelt there no longer .
he must have been trapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss, or else the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy .
i watched from midnight to one o 'clock, when in spite of the sinister house, the unprotected window, and the approaching thunder and lightning, i felt singularly drowsy .
it faced south, with one gable end buried to the lower windows in the eastward rising hill, and the other exposed to the foundations toward the street .
maounds o   ' the dead an' the dyin'    . . .
in another second i was alone in the accursed mansion, shivering and gibbering .
ahead was the robed black man he had seen in the peaked space in the other dream, while from a lesser distance the old woman was beckoning and grimacing imperiously .
let us go to oonai, o iranon of the golden head, where men shall know our longings and welcome us as brothers, nor ever laugh or frown at what we say . ''
he paused exhausted, as the whole group of natives stared in a bewilderment not quite crystallised into fresh terror .
with the years the legends take on a spectral character i suppose the thing, if it was a living thing, must have died .
up the long drive rolled the coaches of the boston gentry, whilst on foot came a numerous assemblage of powdered exquisites from the neighbouring mansions .
the material seemed to be predominantly gold, though a weird lighter lustrousness hinted at some strange alloy with an equally beautiful and scarcely identifiable metal .
into the sunset wandered iranon, seeking still for his native land and for men who would understand and cherish his songs and dreams .
hasheesh helped a great deal, and once sent him to a part of space where form does not exist, but where glowing gases study the secrets of existence .
i seemed to know where i was, but cannot recall what i then knew .
i have said that i dwelt apart from the visible world, but i have not said that i dwelt alone .
these persons were not all cut off suddenly by any one cause; rather did it seem that their vitality was insidiously sapped, so that each one died the sooner from whatever tendency to weakness he may have naturally had .
his build and lower facial features were like other clergymen i had seen, but he had a vastly higher forehead, and was darker and more intelligent looking also more subtly and concealedly evil looking .
on another night kuranes walked up a damp stone spiral stairway endlessly, and came to a tower window overlooking a mighty plain and river lit by the full moon; and in the silent city that spread away from the river bank he thought he beheld some feature or arrangement which he had known before .
the matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me, and at times i had visions of personal fame from researches into its origin and connexions .
and for seventeen years after that west would look frequently over his shoulder, and complain of fancied footsteps behind him .
and old folk tell of pleasing voices heard singing there, and of laughter that swells with joys beyond earth 's joys; and say that at evening the little low windows are brighter than formerly .
how little does the earth self know of life and its extent how little, indeed, ought it to know for its own tranquillity of the oppressor i cannot speak .
and behind the houses were walled rose gardens with hedged paths and sundials, where at evening the moon and stars would shine bewitchingly while fragrant blossoms glistened with dew .
drawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter, i once more consulted the grocery boy 's map with the aid of the flashlight .
he did not respond, and still the viol shrieked on without slackening .
it is well that the reader accept nothing which follows as objective truth, for since the events transcend natural law, they are necessarily the subjective and unreal creations of my overtaxed mind .
i returned to the boat as my electric batteries grew feeble, resolved to explore the rock temple on the following day .
being now afraid to live alone in the ancient house on the moor, i departed on the following day for london, taking with me the amulet after destroying by fire and burial the rest of the impious collection in the museum .
it   's a frightful thing to have alive, but it isn't as bad as what wilbur would have let in if he'd lived longer .
he lives all alone with his streaked cat in gray 's inn, and people call him harmlessly mad .
he was principal of the east high school, born and bred in boston and sharing new england 's self satisfied deafness to the delicate overtones of life .
when near the front door he seemed to think of something, and turned back in his flight, finally disappearing down the stairs to the cellar .
the hermes of kalos stood in a marble shrine in corinth, and the pallas of musides surmounted a pillar in athens, near the parthenon .
after an interval, however, we approached the pit again, and found the exhalations less unbearable .
those scars was it like that? ''
and that look in the staring eyed faces of my grandmother and self slain uncle might be sheer fancy on my part sheer fancy, bolstered up by the innsmouth shadow which had so darkly coloured my imagination .
of scepticism there was none .
warning me that many of the street signs were down, the youth drew for my benefit a rough but ample and painstaking sketch map of the town 's salient features .
over the seas there was a great victory, and in triumph most of the young men returned .
and a thousand years of riches and delight passed over sarnath, wonder of the world and pride of all mankind .
alone i buried him beneath the stones of the courtyard about which he had loved to wander in life .
it struck me as horribly like a sort of oriental ceremony, with beating of drums and chanting of many voices .
he got this in london, i guess he uster like ter buy things at the shops .
nevertheless i followed him; for in those dreary days my quest for antique beauty and mystery was all that i had to keep my soul alive, and i reckoned it a rare favour of fate to fall in with one whose kindred seekings seemed to have penetrated so much farther than mine .

our seat on the tomb was very comfortable, and i knew that my prosaic friend would not mind the cavernous rift in the ancient, root disturbed brickwork close behind us, or the utter blackness of the spot brought by the intervention of a tottering, deserted seventeenth century house between us and the nearest lighted road .

i had a curious desire to look out of that window, over the wall and down the unseen slope at the glittering roofs and spires which must lie outspread there .
then i thought of the abandoned railway to rowley, whose solid line of ballasted, weed grown earth still stretched off to the northwest from the crumbling station on the edge of the river gorge .
the sky grew very dark, and the watchers hoped that the storm would prove a short, sharp one followed by clear weather .

the curious manuscript record or diary of wilbur whateley, delivered to miskatonic university for translation, had caused much worry and bafflement among the experts in languages both ancient and modern; its very alphabet, notwithstanding a general resemblance to the heavily shaded arabic used in mesopotamia, being absolutely unknown to any available authority .
on the occasion of the visit, ran the professor  's manuscript, the sculptor abruptly asked for the benefit of his host's archaeological knowledge in identifying the hieroglyphics on the bas relief .

holding with haeckel that all life is a chemical and physical process, and that the so called  ''soul '' is a myth, my friend believed that artificial reanimation of the dead can depend only on the condition of the tissues; and that unless actual decomposition has set in, a corpse fully equipped with organs may with suitable measures be set going again in the peculiar fashion known as life .
when the view of the water again opened out this time on my right i was half determined not to look at it at all .
the space south of the house, abutting on benefit street, was of course greatly above the existing sidewalk level, forming a terrace bounded by a high bank wall of damp, mossy stone pierced by a steep flight of narrow steps which led inward between canyon like surfaces to the upper region of mangy lawn, rheumy brick walls, and neglected gardens whose dismantled cement urns, rusted kettles fallen from tripods of knotty sticks, and similar paraphernalia set off the weather beaten front door with its broken fanlight, rotting ionic pilasters, and wormy triangular pediment .
the scene i cannot describe i should faint if i tried it, for there is madness in a room full of classified charnel things, with blood and lesser human debris almost ankle deep on the slimy floor, and with hideous reptilian abnormalities sprouting, bubbling, and baking over a winking bluish green spectre of dim flame in a far corner of black shadows .
this thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural malignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a rectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters .
springing to the floor, he washed and dressed in frantic haste, as if it were necessary for him to get out of the house as quickly as possible .
herbert west, whose associate and assistant i was, possessed scientific interests far beyond the usual routine of a village physician .
finally i was sure it was not a face at all, but a fiendishly cunning mask .
a weak, filtered glow from the rain harassed street lamps outside, and a feeble phosphorescence from the detestable fungi within, shewed the dripping stone of the walls, from which all traces of whitewash had vanished; the dank, foetid, and mildew tainted hard earth floor with its obscene fungi; the rotting remains of what had been stools, chairs, and tables, and other more shapeless furniture; the heavy planks and massive beams of the ground floor overhead; the decrepit plank door leading to bins and chambers beneath other parts of the house; the crumbling stone staircase with ruined wooden hand rail; and the crude and cavernous fireplace of blackened brick where rusted iron fragments revealed the past presence of hooks, andirons, spit, crane, and a door to the dutch oven these things, and our austere cot and camp chairs, and the heavy and intricate destructive machinery we had brought .
i believe that my mind was partly unhinged by events since august th; the daemon shadow in the mansion, the general strain and disappointment, and the thing that occurred at the hamlet in an october storm .
it is only the inferior thinker who hastens to explain the singular and the complex by the primitive short cut of supernaturalism .

they must have fixed up some awful scare for that fellow .
it had rested a heavy arm or fore leg on my chest    . . . .
once in a while i noticed dead stumps and crumbling foundation walls above the drifting sand, and recalled the old tradition quoted in one of the histories i had read, that this was once a fertile and thickly settled countryside .
my formerly silent tongue waxed voluble with the easy grace of a chesterfield or the godless cynicism of a rochester .
i likewise did much of his shopping, and gasped in bafflement at some of the chemicals he ordered from druggists and laboratory supply houses .
wisely did ibn schacabao say, that happy is the tomb where no wizard hath lain, and happy the town at night whose wizards are all ashes .
gradually i had come to be his inseparable assistant, and now that we were out of college we had to keep together .
bizarre manifestations were now too frequent to count .

he climbed interminably along the grotesque stone moulding that is, one would call it climbing if the thing was not after all horizontal and the men wondered how any door in the universe could be so vast .
that hallowe 'en the hill noises sounded louder than ever, and fire burned on sentinel hill as usual; but people paid more attention to the rhythmical screaming of vast flocks of unnaturally belated whippoorwills which seemed to be assembled near the unlighted whateley farmhouse .
that night slater slept quietly, and the next morning he wakened with no singular feature save a certain alteration of expression .
the shadow i had seen, i hardly dared to analyse or identify .
i reached out to uncurl and look at it, when suddenly i saw pickman start as if shot .
the expression on her face was one of hideous malevolence and exultation, and when he awaked he could recall a croaking voice that persuaded and threatened .
sometimes it enters directly into the composition of the events, while sometimes it relates only to their fortuitous position among persons and places .
my host appeared not to notice this, and in courtesy i kept silent as he piloted me up a curving stairway, across a hall, and into a room whose door i heard him lock behind us .
romero and i moved without material hesitancy through drifts and down ladders; ever toward the thing that allured us, yet ever with a pitifully helpless fear and reluctance .
two hundred years and more they have leaned or squatted there, while the vines have crawled and the trees have swelled and spread .
as he went upstairs and across the garret hall he sprinkled about some flour which he had borrowed with a frank admission as to its purpose from the landlord .
i can still see herbert west under the sinister electric light as he injected his reanimating solution into the arm of the headless body .

i would have to count on sheer speed, and the chance of getting to a window before any hostile forces became coördinated enough to open the right door toward me with a pass key .
the sphinx is his cousin, and he speaks her language; but he is more ancient than the sphinx, and remembers that which she hath forgotten .
slowly, amidst the distorted horrors of that indescribable scene, she began to churn the lethal waters; whilst on the masonry of that charnel shore that was not of earth the titan thing from the stars slavered and gibbered like polypheme cursing the fleeing ship of odysseus .

i   've had 'em pointed out to me here though, come to think of it, the elder children don't seem to be around lately .
at this point i was left to imagine the solution of the greatest mystery of all, how the curse had been fulfilled since that time when charles le sorcier must in the course of nature have died, for the man digressed into an account of the deep alchemical studies of the two wizards, father and son, speaking most particularly of the researches of charles le sorcier concerning the elixir which should grant to him who partook of it eternal life and youth .
gilman whose ears had so lately possessed an abnormal sensitiveness was now stone deaf .
one might, for example, pass into a timeless dimension and emerge at some remote period of the earth 's history as young as before .

so here we all were in the mystic sunset of the autumn hills old scribonius libo in his toga prætexta, the golden light glancing on his shiny bald head and wrinkled hawk face, balbutius with his gleaming helmet and breastplate, blue shaven lips compressed in conscientiously dogged opposition, young asellius with his polished greaves and superior sneer, and the curious throng of townsfolk, legionaries, tribesmen, peasants, lictors, slaves, and attendants .
on april th the derelict was sighted; and though apparently deserted, was found upon boarding to contain one survivor in a half delirious condition and one man who had evidently been dead for more than a week .
i think that these things were supposed to depict men at least, a certain sort of men; though the creatures were shewn disporting like fishes in the waters of some marine grotto, or paying homage at some monolithic shrine which appeared to be under the waves as well .
i felt sensations like those one feels when accidentally scratching ground glass .
before the marble walls on the appointed night were pitched the pavilions of princes and the tents of travellers, and all the shore resounded with the song of happy revellers .
he reigns there still, and will reign happily forever, though below the cliffs at innsmouth the channel tides played mockingly with the body of a tramp who had stumbled through the half deserted village at dawn; played mockingly, and cast it upon the rocks by ivy covered trevor towers, where a notably fat and especially offensive millionaire brewer enjoys the purchased atmosphere of extinct nobility .

what was the land of these wanderers none could tell; but it was seen that they were given to strange prayers, and that they had painted on the sides of their wagons strange figures with human bodies and the heads of cats, hawks, rams, and lions .
i saw the attic laboratory, the electrical machine, and the unsightly form of tillinghast opposite me; but of all the space unoccupied by familiar material objects not one particle was vacant .
one seldom saw them; but a few times a year they sent down little yellow, squint eyed messengers who looked like scythians to trade with the merchants by means of gestures, and every spring and autumn they held the infamous rites on the peaks, their howlings and altar fires throwing terror into the villages .
the thing must have happened at about three thirty in the afternoon .
i s   'pose it's cheap enough, but i never see more'n two or three people in it nobody but those innsmouth folks .
the curator of the historical society there mr   . e. lapham peabody was very courteous about assisting me, and expressed unusual interest when i told him i was a grandson of eliza orne of arkham, who was born in and had married james williamson of ohio at the age of seventeen.

i am not given to emotion of any kind, but my amazement was very great when i saw what lay revealed in that electrical glow .
i felt conscious of youth because i remembered so little .
and when tales fly thick in the grottoes of tritons, and conches in seaweed cities blow wild tunes learned from the elder ones, then great eager vapours flock to heaven laden with lore; and kingsport, nestling uneasy on its lesser cliffs below that awesome hanging sentinel of rock, sees oceanward only a mystic whiteness, as if the cliff 's rim were the rim of all earth, and the solemn bells of the buoys tolled free in the aether of faery .

as i gazed, i perceived that my own brain held the key to these enchanting metamorphoses; for each vista which appeared to me, was the one my changing mind most wished to behold .
it is not known how long iranon tarried in oonai, but one day the king brought to the palace some wild whirling dancers from the liranian desert, and dusky flute players from drinen in the east, and after that the revellers threw their roses not so much at iranon as at the dancers and the flute players .

but i do not fear him now, for i suspect that he has known horrors beyond my ken .
too many folks missin   ' too much wild preachin' at meetin' of a sunday too much talk abaout that reef .
curtis whateley was only just regaining consciousness when the arkham men came slowly down the mountain in the beams of a sunlight once more brilliant and untainted .
gilman sat in a daze all the afternoon, and elwood who had meanwhile seen the papers and formed terrible conjectures from them found him thus when he came home .
on an improvised dissecting table in the old farmhouse, by the light of a powerful acetylene lamp, the specimen was not very spectral looking .
it was a very foolish hysteria, for the boy had often run away before; but italian peasants are exceedingly superstitious, and this woman seemed as much harassed by omens as by facts .
the effect of this volume had not left me, and i felt a certain hesitancy in speaking of it; but curiosity overmastered all the vague fears which had steadily accumulated since my first glimpse of the house .

of the cattle, only a quarter could be found and identified .
but the archon was sullen and did not understand, and rebuked the stranger .
the ancient books taken from whateley 's quarters, while absorbingly interesting and in several cases promising to open up new and terrible lines of research among philosophers and men of science, were of no assistance whatever in this matter .
still, no one durst complain to the sinister couple; even when little atal, the innkeeper 's son, vowed that he had at twilight seen all the cats of ulthar in that accursed yard under the trees, pacing very slowly and solemnly in a circle around the cottage, two abreast, as if in performance of some unheard of rite of beasts .
at night the subtle stirring of the black city outside, the sinister scurrying of rats in the wormy partitions, and the creaking of hidden timbers in the centuried house, were enough to give him a sense of strident pandemonium .
it was something i found in my coat the next morning .
but now zadok was shaking me, and i turned back to watch the melting of that fear frozen face into a chaos of twitching eyelids and mumbling gums .

my first impulse on awaking was to communicate all my fears and observations to denys barry, but as i saw the sunlight glowing through the latticed east window i became sure that there was no reality in what i thought i had seen .
everything he saw was unspeakably menacing and horrible; and whenever one of the organic entities appeared by its motions to be noticing him, he felt a stark, hideous fright which generally jolted him awake .
this old man dwells all alone in a very ancient house on water street near the sea, and is reputed to be both exceedingly rich and exceedingly feeble; which forms a situation very attractive to men of the profession of messrs  . ricci, czanek, and silva, for that profession was nothing less dignified than robbery.
when the crowd was gone i saw the grave bearded man who had brought me to this place standing alone with a lantern .
and i would tell myself that the realm beyond the wall was not more lasting merely, but more lovely and radiant as well .
this verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbed professor angell .
our means of receiving impressions are absurdly few, and our notions of surrounding objects infinitely narrow .
seeing a possible means of avoiding the dangerous jump, i yanked at the hangings and brought them down, pole and all; then quickly hooking two of the rings in the shutter catch and flinging the drapery outside .

with whimpering insistence the squatters told tales of a daemon which seized lone wayfarers after dark, either carrying them off or leaving them in a frightful state of gnawed dismemberment; while sometimes they whispered of blood trails toward the distant mansion .
there was some of it in wilbur whateley himself enough to make a devil and a precocious monster of him, and to make his passing out a pretty terrible sight .
it seemed strange that old gregory, at least, should desert his master without telling as tried a friend as i .
 ''glad to know you, sheehan, '' said trever in a quiet, well bred tone .
if this man could not be restored to life, no one would know of our experiment .
besides, the streets were loathsomely dark .
he saw that most of them, in common with their cast off priestcraft, could not escape from the delusion that life has a meaning apart from that which men dream into it; and could not lay aside the crude notion of ethics and obligations beyond those of beauty, even when all nature shrieked of its unconsciousness and impersonal unmorality in the light of their scientific discoveries .

snatches of conversation indicated beyond a doubt that neither romero nor i had left the bunkhouse during the night; that neither had been awake during the frightful storm which had passed over the cactus range .
but all these precautions came late in the day, so that gilman had some terrible hints from the dreaded necronomicon of abdul alhazred, the fragmentary book of eibon, and the suppressed unaussprechlichen kulten of von junzt to correlate with his abstract formulae on the properties of space and the linkage of dimensions known and unknown .

the tomb legions when dr  . herbert west disappeared a year ago, the boston police questioned me closely.
there is a false report very commonly reproduced in modern books prior to von schweinkopf  's monumental geschichte der ostrogothen in italien that ibid was a romanised visigoth of ataulf's horde who settled in placentia about a   .d. the contrary cannot be too strongly emphasised; for von schweinkopf, and since his time littlewit and bêtenoir, have shewn with irrefutable force that this strikingly isolated figure was a genuine roman or at least as genuine a roman as that degenerate and mongrelised age could produce of whom one might well say what gibbon said of boethius,  ''that he was the last whom cato or tully could have acknowledged for their countryman. ''
and so the prisoner toiled in the twilight, heaving the unresponsive remnants of mortality with little ceremony as his miniature tower of babel rose course by course .
then in the shadowy solitude my longing for light grew so frantic that i could rest no more, and i lifted entreating hands to the single black ruined tower that reached above the forest into the unknown outer sky .

had he actually slipped outside our sphere to points unguessed and unimaginable?
kuranes had awaked the very moment he beheld the city, yet he knew from his brief glance that it was none other than celephaïs, in the valley of ooth nargai beyond the tanarian hills, where his spirit had dwelt all the eternity of an hour one summer afternoon very long ago, when he had slipt away from his nurse and let the warm sea breeze lull him to sleep as he watched the clouds from the cliff near the village .
the room became pandemonium, and men screamed and howled in fright at the sinister being they had aroused .
he was a man of immense height, probably more than six feet, though his stooping shoulders sometimes belied this fact .
this tranquillity was the more remarkable, because we had amongst us gentlemen of very opposed opinions .
the months following my discovery were spent in futile attempts to force the complicated padlock of the slightly open vault, and in carefully guarded inquiries regarding the nature and history of the structure .
just as they galloped up the rising ground to the precipice a golden glare came somewhere out of the east and hid all the landscape in its effulgent draperies .
his advice, moreover, was eminently practical; for he recommended a postponement of operations at the martense mansion until we might become fortified with more detailed historical and geographical data .
the walls melted away, and i was swept by a black wind through gulfs of fathomless grey with the needle like pinnacles of unknown mountains miles below me .
when tales fly thick in the grottoes of tritons, and conches in seaweed cities blow wild tunes learned from the elder ones, then great eager mists flock to heaven laden with lore, and oceanward eyes on the rocks see only a mystic whiteness, as if the cliff 's rim were the rim of all earth, and the solemn bells of buoys tolled free in the aether of faery .
this man, a vagabond, hunter, and trapper, had always been strange in the eyes of his primitive associates .
mamie 's visit was frankly one of curiosity, and her subsequent tales did justice to her observations; but zechariah came to lead a pair of alderney cows which old whateley had bought of his son curtis .
yet after all, the sight was worse than i had dreaded .
it was good theory, but couldn 't keep up indefinitely .
the most merciful thing in the world, i think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents .
he had turned restlessly on the cot several times during the latter half of the first hour, but now he was breathing with unusual irregularity, occasionally heaving a sigh which held more than a few of the qualities of a choking moan .
i think that whoever nursed me must have been shockingly aged, since my first conception of a living person was that of something mockingly like myself, yet distorted, shrivelled, and decaying like the castle .
next would come the south windows, under the great low eaves on the side where he stood; and it must be said that he was more than uncomfortable as he thought of the detestable house on one side and the vacancy of upper air on the other .
i was glad of that tide, for at high water the fishy smell might not be so bad .
at these times he would shew a sardonic humour and make remarks which the folk of sheehan 's deemed foolish and irrational .
innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable, and i turned down paine street toward the square in the hope of getting some vehicle to take me to arkham before the still distant starting time of that sinister bus .
my back was toward the fishy smelling sea, but he was facing it, and something or other had caused his wandering gaze to light on the low, distant line of devil reef, then shewing plainly and almost fascinatingly above the waves .
sometimes, as a psychological experiment, i would lead him on in these wanderings, and listen to his endless poetical quotations and tales of sunken ships .
but something would have to be done about those rats .
what i did there i may not say, for i am not now sure of the reality of certain things; but i know that on the day after such a nocturnal ramble i would often astonish those about me with my knowledge of topics almost forgotten for many generations .

urged on by an impulse which i cannot definitely analyse, i scrambled with difficulty down the rocks and stood on the gentler slope beneath, gazing into the stygian deeps where no light had yet penetrated .
his thinking processes, once so phlegmatic and logical, had become ineffaceably scarred; and it was pitiful to note his response to certain chance allusions such as  ''friday '',  ''tomb '',  ''coffin '', and words of less obvious concatenation .
the moans of the sick men were decidedly annoying; but since they did not appear to demoralise the rest of the crew, we did not resort to extreme measures .
i looked at zann, and saw that he was past conscious observation .
i think we screamed ourselves as we stumbled frantically toward the town, though as we reached the outskirts we put on a semblance of restraint just enough to seem like belated revellers staggering home from a debauch .
they   've ben telling things about innsmouth whispering 'em, mostly for the last hundred years, i guess, and i gather they're more scared than anything else .
i got into the habit of calling on pickman quite often, especially after i began making notes for a monograph on weird art .

the phantasmal, unmentionable thing occurred one midnight late in march, , in a field hospital behind the lines at st  . eloi.
the great war was then at its very beginning, and the ocean forces of the hun had not completely sunk to their later degradation; so that our vessel was made a legitimate prize, whilst we of her crew were treated with all the fairness and consideration due us as naval prisoners .
and dogs barked as the yellow light of small paned windows shone out at the farther turn, and the pleiades twinkled across the open knoll where a great gambrel roof stood black against the dim west .
there are things about which it is better not to speculate, and all that i can say is that i hate the smell of ammonia, and grow faint at a draught of unusually cool air .
just before he made the plunge the violet light went out and left him in utter blackness .
for some time, apparently, the curious angles of gilman 's room had been having a strange, almost hypnotic effect on him; and as the bleak winter advanced he had found himself staring more and more intently at the corner where the down slanting ceiling met the inward slanting wall .
then one night as i listened at the door i heard the shrieking viol swell into a chaotic babel of sound; a pandemonium which would have led me to doubt my own shaking sanity had there not come from behind that barred portal a piteous proof that the horror was real the awful, inarticulate cry which only a mute can utter, and which rises only in moments of the most terrible fear or anguish .
tillinghast had been watching me, and noted my puzzled expression .

after a moment there came another soft rattling, and i knew that the room to the south of me was being entered .
that we bore electric lanterns, spades, and a curious coil of wire with attached instruments, i will even affirm; for these things all played a part in the single hideous scene which remains burned into my shaken recollection .

brown jenkin was rubbing itself with a kind of affectionate playfulness around the ankles of the black man, which the deep mud largely concealed .
we lived as recluses; devoid of friends, alone, and without servants in a few rooms of an ancient manor house on a bleak and unfrequented moor; so that our doors were seldom disturbed by the knock of the visitor .

dark, frail, and somewhat unkempt in aspect, he turned languidly at my knock and asked me my business without rising .
through all the land of mnar and the lands adjacent spread the tales of those who had fled from sarnath, and caravans sought that accursed city and its precious metals no more .
as i thought of these things i looked out over the squalid sea of decaying roofs below me, now brightened by the beams of a moon not much past full .
it is true that i have for five years been his closest friend, and a partial sharer of his terrible researches into the unknown .

elwood, whose thoughts on the entire episode are sometimes almost maddening, came back to college the next autumn and graduated in the following june .
parker slipped as the other three were plunging frenziedly over endless vistas of green crusted rock to the boat, and johansen swears he was swallowed up by an angle of masonry which shouldn 't have been there; an angle which was acute, but behaved as if it were obtuse .
and their fear and dismay increased when they searched the fallen apartment; for of the gentle musides, and of the marvellously fashioned image of tyché, no trace could be discovered .
next day he would make some very guarded inquiries and perhaps see the nerve specialist .
the title of the picture was,  ''holmes, lowell, and longfellow lie buried in mount auburn '' .

he was unconscious, having fallen in a kind of convulsion which imparted to his slight black clad body a strange rigidity .
the form near me seemed to feel a change also, for it gradually brought its discourse toward a conclusion, and itself prepared to quit the scene; fading from my sight at a rate somewhat less rapid than that of the other objects .
when i had entered the room i had shut the door behind me .
after that the scene was almost wholly kaleidoscopic, and in the jumble of sights, sounds, and unidentified sense impressions i felt that i was about to dissolve or in some way lose the solid form .

then the two rowed to a galley in the harbour, and giving orders to the oarsmen, commenced to sail out into the billowy cerenerian sea that leads to the sky .
at the last moment i decided i had better slacken my trot and make the crossing as before in the shambling gait of an average innsmouth native .
the lodgers and police on that night soothed me, and the doctor administered something to quiet me, nor did anyone see what a nightmare event had taken place .
klenze seemed paralysed and inefficient, as one might expect of a soft, womanish rhinelander .
it was partly because of that laugh that reid dropped him .
our auckland correspondent gives the emma and her crew an excellent reputation, and johansen is described as a sober and worthy man .
i had largely given over my inquiries into what professor angell called the  ''cthulhu cult '', and was visiting a learned friend in paterson, new jersey; the curator of a local museum and a mineralogist of note .
when he took down the shutter the wind and rain howled deafeningly in, so that i could not hear what he said; but i waited while he leaned out and tried to fathom nature 's pandemonium .
it was after this that he cultivated deliberate illusion, and dabbled in the notions of the bizarre and the eccentric as an antidote for the commonplace .
despite their distance below me i at once knew they were the servants brought from the north, for i recognised the ugly and unwieldy form of the cook, whose very absurdness had now become unutterably tragic .
now, in spite of all that guidance, alfred trever was at sheehan 's and about to take his first drink .
family and neighbours had now fled in a panic, and when the more courageous of them returned, slater was gone, leaving behind an unrecognisable pulp like thing that had been a living man but an hour before .
that he was right, i soon learned from the unutterable fear which engulfed me whenever consciousness lapsed .
people around the country and in the nearby towns muttered a great deal among themselves, but said very little to the outer world .
with only a slight churning to mark its rise to the surface, the thing slid into view above the dark waters .

it had for some time been noticed that dogs had begun to hate and fear the whole whateley place as violently as they hated and feared young wilbur personally .
the present voodoo orgy was, indeed, on the merest fringe of this abhorred area, but that location was bad enough; hence perhaps the very place of the worship had terrified the squatters more than the shocking sounds and incidents .
all were pointing to a certain passage, and every face seemed so distorted with epileptic and reverberant laughter that i almost thought i heard the fiendish echoes .
i was celebrating my coming of age by a tour of new england sightseeing, antiquarian, and genealogical and had planned to go directly from ancient newburyport to arkham, whence my mother 's family was derived .

as soon as dombrowski left it the pall of its final desolation began to descend, for people shunned it both on account of its old reputation and because of the new foetid odour .
he will, i believe, some time be heard from as one of the great decadents; for he has crystallised in clay and will one day mirror in marble those nightmares and phantasies which arthur machen evokes in prose, and clark ashton smith makes visible in verse and in painting .
so little is known of what went on beneath the surface so little, yet such a ghastly festering as it bubbles up putrescently in occasional ghoulish glimpses .
as i thought of him new terrors convulsed me, and i fell to the floor; not fainting, but physically helpless .
he watched and listened with his mind more than with his eyes and ears, and strove every moment to drown something in his ceaseless poring over gay, insipid novels .
 ''oh, my gawd, my gawd, '' the voice choked out .
i was sorry i had put out the light, yet was too tired to rise and turn it on again .
instead there was a clatter of people coming up with lanterns, for the spell of phantasmal silence had broken, and i once more heard sounds and saw figures as normally tri dimensional .
someone telephoned the news to the aylesbury transcript; but the editor, accustomed to wild tales from dunwich, did no more than concoct a humorous paragraph about it; an item soon afterward reproduced by the associated press .

now, after a moment of silence during which the walker may have been inspecting my bicycle in the hall, i heard a fumbling at the latch and saw the panelled portal swing open again .

considerable talk was started when silas bishop of the undecayed bishops mentioned having seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother about an hour before the blaze was remarked .
once inside one of the decrepit brick structures i would have to reckon with pursuit; but i hoped to descend and dodge in and out of yawning doorways along the shadowed courtyard, eventually getting to washington street and slipping out of town toward the south .
most of the students went home, or to various duties, as the evening advanced; but west persuaded me to aid him in  ''making a night of it '' .

as time wore along, his absorption in the irregular wall and ceiling of his room increased; for he began to read into the odd angles a mathematical significance which seemed to offer vague clues regarding their purpose .
i had read many scrolls out of syria and ægyptus, and the cryptic towns of etruria, and had talked at length with the bloodthirsty priest of diana aricina in his temple in the woods bordering lacus nemorensis .
the moon, now near the zenith, shone weirdly and vividly above the towering steeps that hemmed in the chasm, and revealed the fact that a far flung body of water flowed at the bottom, winding out of sight in both directions, and almost lapping my feet as i stood on the slope .
baleful primal trees of unholy size, age, and grotesqueness leered above me like the pillars of some hellish druidic temple; muffling the thunder, hushing the clawing wind, and admitting but little rain .
into the north window of my chamber glows the pole star with uncanny light .
an inappropriate hour, a jarring lighting effect, or a clumsy manipulation of the damp sod, would almost totally destroy for us that ecstatic titillation which followed the exhumation of some ominous, grinning secret of the earth .
nothing can be put back now .
i might never have known dr  . muñoz had it not been for the heart attack that suddenly seized me one forenoon as i sat writing in my room.
it would perhaps have been easier to keep my thoughts from disturbing topics had the room not been so gruesomely musty .
dr  . muñoz, most certainly, was a man of birth, cultivation, and discrimination.
once we fancied that a large, opaque body darkened the library window when the moon was shining against it, and another time we thought we heard a whirring or flapping sound not far off .
this collection frightens away most of the small boys who love to taunt the terrible old man about his long white hair and beard, or to break the small paned windows of his dwelling with wicked missiles; but there are other things which frighten the older and more curious folk who sometimes steal up to the house to peer in through the dusty panes .

with this work romero and i were not connected, wherefore our first knowledge of extraordinary conditions came from others .
the old man was panting, and perspiring profusely .
after a number of calculations west decided that it represented some secret chamber beneath the tomb of the averills, where the last interment had been made in  .
i struck several matches in succession, and desperately regretted the improvidence which had caused us long ago to use up the few candles we carried .
of graves and tombs i knew and imagined much, but had on account of my peculiar temperament been kept from all personal contact with churchyards and cemeteries .
they were huguenots from caude, and had encountered much opposition before the providence selectmen allowed them to settle in the town .
nor did anything that had been alive come alive from the ruins .

i  'm going to burn his accursed diary, and if you men are wise you'll dynamite that altar stone up there, and pull down all the rings of standing stones on the other hills .
all honour was now his, since the tyrant of syracuse would have the work of none save him or kalos .
and when the red aldebaran had crawled more than half way around the horizon, there were again darkness and silence .

they from outside will help, but they cannot take body without human blood .
with this friend, joel manton, i had often languidly disputed .
he told me it was an old german viol player, a strange dumb man who signed his name as erich zann, and who played evenings in a cheap theatre orchestra; adding that zann 's desire to play in the night after his return from the theatre was the reason he had chosen this lofty and isolated garret room, whose single gable window was the only point on the street from which one could look over the terminating wall at the declivity and panorama beyond .
manton remained thoughtful as i said this, but gradually reverted to his analytical mood .
then they both started for the outer door; the woman lamely creeping, and the old man, after picking up the very book i had been reading, beckoning me as he drew his hood over that unmoving face or mask .
the disposition of old bugs was as odd as his aspect .
he was good for nothing that morning, and stayed away from all his classes .

so came he one night to the squalid cot of an antique shepherd, bent and dirty, who kept lean flocks on a stony slope above a quicksand marsh .
the next day both youths felt very tired, and knew they would sleep like logs when night came .
endlessly down the horsemen floated, their chargers pawing the aether as if galloping over golden sands; and then the luminous vapours spread apart to reveal a greater brightness, the brightness of the city celephaïs, and the sea coast beyond, and the snowy peak overlooking the sea, and the gaily painted galleys that sail out of the harbour toward distant regions where the sea meets the sky .
then came a period when luck was poor; interments fell off, and those that did occur were of specimens either too diseased or too maimed for use .
the event which i am about to relate was unheralded by long premonitions .
  ''that is, sailors that didn't hail from innsmouth .
and her friend pete stowacki would not help because he wanted the child out of the way anyhow .
and again we saw a tram car, lone, windowless, dilapidated, and almost on its side .
and there were many small shrines and temples where one might rest or pray to small gods .
but though iranon was sad he ceased not to sing, and at evening told again his dreams of aira, the city of marble and beryl .
the most sumptuous of these with wide terraced parterres extending back the whole way to lafayette street i took to be the home of old man marsh, the afflicted refinery owner .
they never unlocked that attic door, but left the whole house as it was, dreaded and deserted .
wretched is he who looks back upon lone hours in vast and dismal chambers with brown hangings and maddening rows of antique books, or upon awed watches in twilight groves of grotesque, gigantic, and vine encumbered trees that silently wave twisted branches far aloft .
his habitual expression was one of kindly and well bred calm, whereas now a variety of emotions seemed struggling within him .
my head, heavy and reeling, drooped to my breast, and when next i looked up it was in a dream; with the pole star grinning at me through a window from over the horrible swaying trees of a dream swamp .
its rowers, though distantly and indistinctly seen, were of an especially repellent aspect .
i was pouring something from one test tube to another, and west was busy over the alcohol blast lamp which had to answer for a bunsen burner in this gasless edifice, when from the pitch black room we had left there burst the most appalling and daemoniac succession of cries that either of us had ever heard .
whilst the greater number of our nocturnal visions are perhaps no more than faint and fantastic reflections of our waking experiences freud to the contrary with his puerile symbolism there are still a certain remainder whose immundane and ethereal character permits of no ordinary interpretation, and whose vaguely exciting and disquieting effect suggests possible minute glimpses into a sphere of mental existence no less important than physical life, yet separated from that life by an all but impassable barrier .
dolphins still encircled the u , a somewhat remarkable circumstance considering the distance we had covered .
we had met years before, in medical school, and from the first i had shared his terrible researches .
it isn  't so very far from the elevated as distance goes, but it's centuries away as the soul goes .
it is to meet and conquer the oppressor that i have vainly striven for aeons, held back by bodily encumbrances .
it may have been just fear, and it may have been fear mixed with a queer belated sort of remorse for bygone crudities .
wonder had gone away, and he had forgotten that all life is only a set of pictures in the brain, among which there is no difference betwixt those born of real things and those born of inward dreamings, and no cause to value the one above the other .
and as if sharpened by the coming deprivation of light, my desire to explore the watery secrets grew .
he worked northwest along pleasant back roads, past hooper  's pond and the old brick powder house to where the pastures slope up to the ridge above the miskatonic and give a lovely vista of arkham's white georgian steeples across leagues of river and meadow .
just how fully the pursuit was organised and indeed, just what its purpose might be i could form no idea .
trying it, i found it locked; but with a supreme burst of strength i overcame all obstacles and dragged it open inward .
the air was warm and stirred not .
then they vanished, hurrying southward where they were fully a month overdue .
on the third morning of the wanderers ' stay in ulthar, menes could not find his kitten; and as he sobbed aloud in the market place certain villagers told him of the old man and his wife, and of sounds heard in the night .
i seem to ramble along without much logick or continuity when i endeavour to recall the past; and fear i light upon but few incidents which others have not before discuss 'd .
among the kaliris was an aged chief called mwanu, who possessed not only a highly retentive memory, but a singular degree of intelligence and interest in old legends .
their arrangement was odd, and seemed to follow the symmetries of some cosmic geometry unknown to earth or the solar system .
the negro had been knocked out, and a moment 's examination shewed us that he would permanently remain so .
slightly later, when a change and a gentle tremor seemed to affect the dead limbs, west stuffed a pillow like object violently over the twitching face, not withdrawing it until the corpse appeared quiet and ready for our attempt at reanimation .
in saying that west 's fear of his specimens was nebulous, i have in mind particularly its complex nature .
at last the figure spoke in a rumbling voice that chilled me through with its dull hollowness and latent malevolence .
the change happened whilst i slept .
they had chained him down to things that are, and had then explained the workings of those things till mystery had gone out of the world .
shaken with such a mental revolution as i had never before known, i now resolved to visit mate johansen in oslo .
  ''i believe there's a chance of putting it out of business .
i will tell only of the lone tomb in the darkest of the hillside thickets; the deserted tomb of the hydes, an old and exalted family whose last direct descendant had been laid within its black recesses many decades before my birth .
all my days have i watched it and listened to it, and i know it well .
it may have been wholly an hallucination from the shock caused at that instant by the sudden and complete destruction of the building in a cataclysm of german shell fire who can gainsay it, since west and i were the only proved survivors?
controlling my muscles, and realising afresh how plainly visible i was, i resumed my brisker and feignedly shambling pace; though keeping my eyes on that hellish and ominous reef as long as the opening of south street gave me a seaward view .
yet the force of the elements was such as to overcome my scruples, and i did not hesitate to wheel my machine up the weedy rise to the closed door which seemed at once so suggestive and secretive .
there were eaten many strange delicacies at that feast; peacocks from the isles of nariel in the middle ocean, young goats from the distant hills of implan, heels of camels from the bnazic desert, nuts and spices from cydathrian groves, and pearls from wave washed mtal dissolved in the vinegar of thraa .
some new and wild note in the drumming and chanting, perceptible but slightly to me, had acted on him in startling fashion; and with a wild outcry he forged ahead unguided in the cavern 's gloom .
god knows how many there were there must have been thousands .
a second later the downward motion of the knife broke the spell completely, and he dropped the bowl with a resounding bell like clangour while his hands darted out frantically to stop the monstrous deed .
he was gazing at me gaspingly and fascinatedly, but did not seem afraid .
the bolt fitted perfectly, and i was somewhat relieved when i knew that i could shoot it firmly upon retiring .
i calc     'late i was asleep, else i'd a heerd ye i ain't as young as i uster be, an' i need a paowerful sight o' naps naowadays .
i now bent to the left around the ruinous green; still gazing toward the ocean as it blazed in the spectral summer moonlight, and watching the cryptical flashing of those nameless, unexplainable beacons .
then he said we were the victims of a vicious bull though the animal was a difficult thing to place and account for .
there were secrets, said the peasants, which must not be uncovered; secrets that had lain hidden since the plague came to the children of partholan in the fabulous years beyond history .
ahead rose a narrow staircase, flanked by a small door probably leading to the cellar, while to the left and right were closed doors leading to rooms on the ground floor .
men looked at one another and muttered .

from the air of hushed fright at osborn 's store they knew something hideous had happened, and soon learned of the annihilation of the elmer frye house and family .
he hailed from arkham, boarded with a family who came from ipswich, and went back home whenever he got a moment off .
toward the last i became acutely afraid of west, for he began to look at me that way .
with five feeble senses we pretend to comprehend the boundlessly complex cosmos, yet other beings with a wider, stronger, or different range of senses might not only see very differently the things we see, but might see and study whole worlds of matter, energy, and life which lie close at hand yet can never be detected with the senses we have .
leaning my cycle against the wall i opened the door at the left, and crossed into a small low ceiled chamber but dimly lighted by its two dusty windows and furnished in the barest and most primitive possible way .
looks like a terrible rattletrap i 've never ben on it . ''
leading me within, he steered a course in utter blackness over what seemed to be a gravel path, and finally up a flight of stone steps to the door of the house, which he unlocked and opened for me .
their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid, while their heads were the heads of fish, with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed .
besides, what was found might possibly have more than one explanation .
he evidently feared the physical effect of violent emotion, yet his will and driving force waxed rather than waned, and he refused to be confined to his bed .
he did not wish to go to sleep in a room alone especially since he thought he had glimpsed in the evening twilight the repellent old woman whose image had become so horribly transferred to his dreams .
i have always believed that such strange, inaccessible worlds exist at our very elbows, and now i believe i have found a way to break down the barriers .
vast, polyphemus like, and loathsome, it darted like a stupendous monster of nightmares to the monolith, about which it flung its gigantic scaly arms, the while it bowed its hideous head and gave vent to certain measured sounds .
for that visitor was neither italian nor policeman .
yog sothoth is the key to the gate, whereby the spheres meet .
there he would ask to be left alone, as if wishing to speak with unseen things .
i hardly know how to continue, since conditions so singular are involved; but i will do my best, not even trying to differentiate betwixt the real and the apparent .
once he had the landlord nail tin over it, but the next night the rats gnawed a fresh hole in making which they pushed or dragged out into the room a curious little fragment of bone .
no, he said hastily, as the question was put to him, he did not know the subject of the picture .
one must not, for example, linger much around the marsh refinery, or around any of the still used churches, or around the pillared order of dagon hall at new church green .
many of his questions seemed highly out of place to his visitor, especially those which tried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies; and wilcox could not understand the repeated promises of silence which he was offered in exchange for an admission of membership in some widespread mystical or paganly religious body .
but after a time his alcohol enfeebled brain would wander from the subject, and with a foolish grin he would turn once more to his mop or cleaning rag .
learning was in his blood, for his great grandfather, sir robert jermyn, bt  ., had been an anthropologist of note, whilst his great great great grandfather, sir wade jermyn, was one of the earliest explorers of the congo region, and had written eruditely of its tribes, animals, and supposed antiquities.
the shell had been merciful, in a way but west could never feel as certain as he wished, that we two were the only survivors .
  ''this is my first experience in a place like this, but i am a student of life, and don't want to miss any experience .
i do not know just how much of the whole tale has been told even to me, and i have many reasons for not wishing to probe deeper .
between gasps luther tried to stammer out his tale to mrs  . corey.
west was then a small, slender, spectacled youth with delicate features, yellow hair, pale blue eyes, and a soft voice, and it was uncanny to hear him dwelling on the relative merits of christchurch cemetery and the potter 's field .
during this description i had kept a tight rein on my emotions, but my face must have betrayed my mounting fears .
his features had perhaps been noble once, but were now seamed with the ghastly effects of terrible dissipation .
we could not get bodies fresh enough to shew any trace of reason when reanimated, so had perforce created nameless horrors .
it surely was bad enough there was riots over it, and all sorts of ghastly doings that i don 't believe ever got outside of town and it left the place in awful shape .
so far i had seen no people in the town, but there now came signs of a sparse habitation curtained windows here and there, and an occasional battered motor car at the curb .
to this day i do not know whether they saw me or not .
human utterance can best convey the general character of our experiences by calling them plungings or soarings; for in every period of revelation some part of our minds broke boldly away from all that is real and present, rushing aërially along shocking, unlighted, and fear haunted abysses, and occasionally tearing through certain well marked and typical obstacles describable only as viscous, uncouth clouds or vapours .
they talked of the old cotter and his wife, of the caravan of dark wanderers, of small menes and his black kitten, of the prayer of menes and of the sky during that prayer, of the doings of the cats on the night the caravan left, and of what was later found in the cottage under the dark trees in the repellent yard .
the doctor, though, was chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds outside; a seemingly limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their endless message in repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps of the dying man .
he did not know where he wished to go, but felt that once more he would have to sacrifice his classes .
curtis whateley of the undecayed branch was holding the telescope when the arkham party detoured radically from the swath .
i moved my hand to his head, whose mechanical nodding i was able to stop, and shouted in his ear that we must both flee from the unknown things of the night .
there are vocal qualities peculiar to men, and vocal qualities peculiar to beasts; and it is terrible to hear the one when the source should yield the other .
soon cross streets and junctions began to appear; those on the left leading to shoreward realms of unpaved squalor and decay, while those on the right shewed vistas of departed grandeur .
it was a grey, bleak day, with now and then a drizzle of rain; and heavier and heavier clouds seemed to be piling themselves up beyond the hills to the northwest .
our freedom from long sleep was surprising, for seldom did we succumb more than an hour or two at a time to the shadow which had now grown so frightful a menace .
then came a noxious rush of noisome, frigid air from that same dreaded direction, followed by a piercing shriek just beside me on that shocking rifted tomb of man and monster .
birch, before , had been the village undertaker of peck valley; and was a very calloused and primitive specimen even as such specimens go .
if it came from within the house, we had the window ladders; if from outside, the door and the stairs .
his wilder wanderings were very startling indeed, including frantic appeals that something in a boarded up farmhouse be destroyed, and fantastic references to some plan for the extirpation of the entire human race and all animal and vegetable life from the earth by some terrible elder race of beings from another dimension .
they would perhaps be the worst of all innsmouth types something one would not care to remember .
i will not deny, though my memory is uncertain and indistinct, that this witness of yours may have seen us together as he says, on the gainesville pike, walking toward big cypress swamp, at half past eleven on that awful night .
those visions, however, were of abhorrent vividness and convincingness, and whenever he awaked he retained a vague sense of having undergone much more than he remembered .
i myself would have thought of biological degeneration rather than alienage .
for what could be the meaning of the queer clay bas relief and the disjointed jottings, ramblings, and cuttings which i found?
i must have left dust prints in that last old building, revealing how i had gained the street .
you, sir, are the first outsider to be told there is a secret, and split me if i 'd have risked tampering that much with the powers had ye not been so hot after bygone things . ''
there was an open space around the church; partly a churchyard with spectral shafts, and partly a half paved square swept nearly bare of snow by the wind, and lined with unwholesomely archaic houses having peaked roofs and overhanging gables .
he knows where they have trod earth 's fields, and where they still tread them, and why no one can behold them as they tread .
this daemoniac laughter which i hear as i write comes only from my own weakening brain .
i know i  'm more nervous than i was when you saw me last year, but you don't need to hold a clinic over it .
i glanced back at the sea, but there was nothing there .
you know what he wants .
almost the first long passage that armitage deciphered, an entry dated november , , proved highly startling and disquieting .
so famous were kalos and musides, that none wondered when the tyrant of syracuse sent to them deputies to speak of the costly statue of tyché which he had planned for his city .
once a student of reanimation, this silent trunk was now gruesomely called upon to exemplify it .
west had a private laboratory in an east room of the barn like temporary edifice, assigned him on his plea that he was devising new and radical methods for the treatment of hitherto hopeless cases of maiming .
where if anywhere had he been on those nights of daemoniac alienage?
there was a brief silence, and in that pause the scattered senses of poor curtis whateley began to knit back into a sort of continuity; so that he put his hands to his head with a moan .
i went to the war, an   ' ef i'd a had any guts or sense i'd a never come back, but settled away from here .

they are on the duke   's wedding, and so much resemble in quality the work of other and more recent poetick dunces, that i cannot forbear copying them:  ''when the duke of leeds shall marry'd be to a fine young lady of high quality how happy will that gentlewoman be in his grace of leeds' good company . ''
why had it picked them, and left me for the last?    . . .

his clutch relaxed, and as he saw my disgust and offence his own anger seemed to subside .
in the ashes of the fateful cabin i found several bones, but apparently none of the monster 's .
that afternoon we found the new grave, and determined to begin work soon after midnight .
our experiences had often been hideous in the extreme; the results of defective reanimation, when lumps of graveyard clay had been galvanised into morbid, unnatural, and brainless motion by various modifications of the vital solution .
in his glance there is not any restless light, and if he ever listens for solemn bells or far elfin horns it is only at night when old dreams are wandering .
then he took me through a door on the left, lighted an oil lamp, and told me to make myself at home .
armitage, hastening into some clothing and rushing across the street and lawn to the college buildings, saw that others were ahead of him; and heard the echoes of a burglar alarm still shrilling from the library .
later a queer boldness and recklessness came into my demeanour, till i unconsciously grew to possess the bearing of a man of the world despite my lifelong seclusion .
elwood scarcely dared to touch him, but gradually the screaming and writhing subsided .
a common white handkerchief found among forest rocks on the hillside beyond cannot be identified as belonging to the missing man .
whether i shall go as he did remains to be seen, for i have learned much now .
and the bearded man again implored me to turn back, but i heeded him not; for from the mists beyond the basalt pillars i fancied there came the notes of singer and lutanist; sweeter than the sweetest songs of sona nyl, and sounding mine own praises; the praises of me, who had voyaged far under the full moon and dwelt in the land of fancy .
my father secured me a place in an insurance office, and i buried myself in routine as deeply as possible .

major sir eric moreland clapham lee, d     .s.o., was the greatest surgeon in our division, and had been hastily assigned to the st. eloi sector when news of the heavy fighting reached headquarters.
then we both tried together, and with exotic drugs courted terrible and forbidden dreams in the tower studio chamber of the old manor house in hoary kent .
there he worked like a butcher in the midst of his gory wares i could never get used to the levity with which he handled and classified certain things .
had they known, the coincidence of names would have brought some drastic and frightened action indeed, might not its limited whispering have precipitated the final riot which erased the roulets from the town?
of genuine blood there was none; only the foetid greenish yellow ichor which trickled along the painted floor beyond the radius of the stickiness, and left a curious discolouration behind it .
at times he actually did perform marvels of surgery for the soldiers; but his chief delights were of a less public and philanthropic kind, requiring many explanations of sounds which seemed peculiar even amidst that babel of the damned .
one evening as i strolled on victoria embankment for some needed air, i saw a black shape obscure one of the reflections of the lamps in the water .
the cracked lips tried to frame words which i could not well understand .

no one, however, had been using the telescope at that instant .

this original correspondence was not preserved, but his notes formed a thorough and really significant digest .
the trunk had moved intelligently; and, unbelievable to relate, we were both sickeningly sure that articulate sounds had come from the detached head as it lay in a shadowy corner of the laboratory .
outwardly he was the same to the last calm, cold, slight, and yellow haired, with spectacled blue eyes and a general aspect of youth which years and fears seemed never to change .
his haousekeeper sally was carryin         ' on fit ter kill she'd jest seed the trees a bendin' beside the rud, an' says they was a kind o' mushy saound, like a elephant puffin' an' treadin', a headin' fer the haouse .
very little time had elapsed before i saw the attempt was not to be a total failure .
the thing itself, however, crowded out all other images at the time .
i barely fancied that as i awoke, a light had been hurriedly extinguished within the sunken sepulchre .
of this infirmity, indeed, i had known before; having heard of it from mr  . pope, who took the trouble to make particular inquiries.
the dirty looking fellow who waited on me had a touch of the staring  ''innsmouth look '', but was quite civil in his way; being perhaps used to the custom of such convivial strangers truckmen, gold buyers, and the like as were occasionally in town .

this was always at night in the day he slept and would admit no one .
he wasn 't strictly human .
it was from kilderry that his father had come, and it was there that he wished to enjoy his wealth among ancestral scenes .
that inspector 's story must have worked on my imagination more deeply than i had suspected .
and before he died, taran ish had scrawled upon the altar of chrysolite with coarse shaky strokes the sign of doom .
the stench left quickly, but the vegetation never came right again .
this bower was my temple, the fastened door my shrine, and here i would lie outstretched on the mossy ground, thinking strange thoughts and dreaming strange dreams .
thar     's his head on thet bench, with one arm side of it, an' t'other arm's on the graound side o' the meat block . ''
briden 's death reveals no apparent cause, and was probably due to excitement or exposure .
don 't ask me what it is they see .

later i must have dropped asleep again, for it was out of a phantasmal chaos that my mind leaped when the night grew hideous with shrieks beyond anything in my former experience or imagination .
without having any exact knowledge of geology, i had from the first been interested in the odd mounds and hummocks of the region .
no sane person had even seen it, and few had ever felt it definitely .
in another week the burgomaster decided to overcome his fears and call at the strangely silent dwelling as a matter of duty, though in so doing he was careful to take with him shang the blacksmith and thul the cutter of stone as witnesses .
we met no person, and as time passed the lighted windows became fewer and fewer .
but west 's gentle enemies were no less harassed with prostrating duties .
nobody cud git aout o   ' them whar they got all the stuff, an' all the other natives wondered haow they managed to find fish in plenty even when the very next islands had lean pickin's .
it is natural that such a thing as a dead man 's scream should give horror, for it is obviously not a pleasing or ordinary occurrence; but i was used to similar experiences, hence suffered on this occasion only because of a particular circumstance .
might not the deeper inquiries of my uncle after encountering the sculptor 's data have come to sinister ears?
the hour was one of approaching triumph, for was not my fellow being escaping at last from a degrading periodic bondage; escaping forever, and preparing to follow the accursed oppressor even unto the uttermost fields of ether, that upon it might be wrought a flaming cosmic vengeance which would shake the spheres?
the men, busy with labour, waxed prosperous and as happy as they knew how to be .

it is palpably a part of the valley wall, though how the vast interior was ever excavated i cannot imagine .

with new vigour i applied myself to my examination of the old chateau and its contents .
seeking shelter from the increasing rainfall beneath one of the few undestroyed frye outbuildings, they debated the wisdom of waiting, or of taking the aggressive and going down into the glen in quest of their nameless, monstrous quarry .
excavation was much easier than i expected, though at one point i encountered a queer interruption; when a lean vulture darted down out of the cold sky and pecked frantically at the grave earth until i killed him with a blow of my spade .
innsmouth itself was left almost depopulated, and is even now only beginning to shew signs of a sluggishly revived existence .
zadok was shewing signs of fright and exhaustion, and i let him keep silence for a while, though glancing apprehensively at my watch .
and among the dead faces was the living, mocking face of the youth with the ivory image .
in odd contrast to the tiara 's aspect was its brief and prosy history as related by miss tilton .
i had noticed that they were pretty widely distributed around tempest mountain, though less numerous on the plain than near the hill top itself, where prehistoric glaciation had doubtless found feebler opposition to its striking and fantastic caprices .
as they reached the broad open space where i had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlit water i could see them plainly only a block away and was horrified by the bestial abnormality of their faces and the dog like sub humanness of their crouching gait .
on this deep bony layer rested a knife of great size, obvious antiquity, and grotesque, ornate, and exotic design above which the debris was piled .
tillinghast was grinning repulsively at the revolver which i had almost unconsciously drawn, but from his expression i was sure he had seen and heard as much as i, if not a great deal more .
also, he thinks some of the folks looks durned queer even fer kanakys .
his blue eyes were bulging, glassy, and sightless, and the frantic playing had become a blind, mechanical, unrecognisable orgy that no pen could even suggest .
still too dazed to cry out, he plunged recklessly down the noisome staircase and into the mud outside; halting only when seized and choked by the waiting black man .
when i think of the extent of all that may be brooding down there i almost wish to kill myself forthwith .
my father, his face lined with sorrow, stood by as i shouted my demands to be laid within the tomb; frequently admonishing my captors to treat me as gently as they could .
i heard the phial break harmlessly against the stones of the passage as the tunic of the strange man caught fire and lit the horrid scene with a ghastly radiance .

when sir robert jermyn emerged from his library he left behind the strangled corpse of the explorer, and before he could be restrained, had put an end to all three of his children; the two who were never seen, and the son who had run away .
i can recall the scene now the desolate, pitch black garret studio under the eaves with the rain beating down; the ticking of the lone clock; the fancied ticking of our watches as they rested on the dressing table; the creaking of some swaying shutter in a remote part of the house; certain distant city noises muffled by fog and space; and worst of all the deep, steady, sinister breathing of my friend on the couch a rhythmical breathing which seemed to measure moments of supernal fear and agony for his spirit as it wandered in spheres forbidden, unimagined, and hideously remote .
that last scare had come while i was reaching to uncurl it, and it seems i had vacantly crumpled it into my pocket .
ceasing my futile and now objectless writhing, i watched the spectators as they viewed the treasure trove, and was permitted to share in their discoveries .
he cut himself off hurriedly, and no amount of persuasion or subtlety could elicit more in this direction .
there are not many persons who know what wonders are opened to them in the stories and visions of their youth; for when as children we listen and dream, we think but half formed thoughts, and when as men we try to remember, we are dulled and prosaic with the poison of life .
the only thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly; imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth folk as best i could, and trusting that no one or at least no pursuer of mine would be there .
god knows, though, that the prosy tale which george birch 's death permits me to tell has in it aspects beside which some of our darkest tragedies are light .
all the terror i had dimly felt before rushed upon me actively and vividly, and i knew that i loathed the ancient and abhorrent creature so near me with an infinite intensity .
shrouded in mist they were, so that no man might peer beyond them or see their summits which indeed some say reach even to the heavens .
and the bearded man made enigmatical gestures of prayer, and lit tall candles in curiously wrought brass candlesticks .
it was in those college days that he had begun his terrible experiments, first on small animals and then on human bodies shockingly obtained .
many days they travelled, and from afar saw lofty hatheg kla with his aureole of mournful mist .
    ''when a gen'l'man wants tuh take a drink here, by god, he shall, without you interferin' .
later i told harris only through sheer necessity, and because he had heard odd tales from old people which disposed him ever so little toward belief .
his ears were ringing horribly, as if with the residual echoes of some horrible noise heard in dreams .
but johansen had not given out yet .
kuranes was now very anxious to return to minaret studded celephaïs, and increased his doses of drugs; but eventually he had no more money left, and could buy no drugs .
barzai was wise in the lore of earth 's gods, and listened hard for certain sounds, but atal felt the chill of the vapours and the awe of the night, and feared much .
i heard zann stumble to the window and close both shutter and sash, then stumble to the door, which he falteringly unfastened to admit me .
it might be in the visible world, yet it might be only in his mind and soul .
i knew that i could not accost him then and there, for the firemen would surely notice and object .

moreover, to this day the people of ulthar and nir and hatheg fear eclipses, and pray by night when pale vapours hide the mountain top and the moon .
and yet as one reared in the best kultur of prussia i should not have been amazed, for geology and tradition alike tell us of great transpositions in oceanic and continental areas .
i did not like everything about what i saw, and felt again the fear i had had .
and the tomb where you put those bones, and the other grave without an inscription the whole thing must be a bit terrible . ''
gilman 's handling of this theme filled everyone with admiration, even though some of his hypothetical illustrations caused an increase in the always plentiful gossip about his nervous and solitary eccentricity .
south of the village one may still spy the cellar walls and chimney of the ancient bishop house, which was built before ; whilst the ruins of the mill at the falls, built in , form the most modern piece of architecture to be seen .
in the days of my grandfather there were many; in the days of my father not so many; and now there are so few that i sometimes feel strangely alone, as though i were the last man on our planet .
the thing which had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore; an almost exact duplicate of the one miss tilton had shewn me the previous evening .
at the y     .m.c.a., where i was stopping, the clerk merely discouraged my going to such a dismal, decadent place; and the people at the library shewed much the same attitude.
all day i forged steadily westward, guided by a far away hummock which rose higher than any other elevation on the rolling desert .
and over all rose thoughts and fears which centred in the youth from the sea and the ivory image whose carving was duplicated on the frieze and columns of the temple before me .
an increasing and unexplained atmosphere of panic seemed to rise around his apartment .
tucked obscurely away in a corner of the arkham advertiser was a facetious little item from the associated press, telling what a record breaking monster the bootleg whiskey of dunwich had raised up .
it undulated too much, and glistened too brightly in the rays of the now westering moon .

entering, i began to use my flashlight, and was almost knocked down by the cloud of bats that flapped past me .
loathsomeness waits and dreams in the deep, and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men .
previously indifferent to such things, i had now an unspeakable horror of them; and would retire to the innermost recesses of the house whenever the heavens threatened an electrical display .
then came the steady rattling at the back door .
rushing through the newly opened connexion, i succeeded in bolting the northerly hall door before the lock could be turned; but even as i did so i heard the hall door of the third room the one from whose window i had hoped to reach the roof below being tried with a pass key .
once i thrust a candle within the nearly closed entrance, but could see nothing save a flight of damp stone steps leading downward .
despite weakness, hunger, horror, and bewilderment i found myself after a long time able to walk; so started slowly along the muddy road to rowley .
the fear, however, is an old tradition throughout the neighbouring villages; since it is a prime topic in the simple discourse of the poor mongrels who sometimes leave their valleys to trade hand woven baskets for such primitive necessities as they cannot shoot, raise, or make .
on may eve of there were tremors which even the aylesbury people felt, whilst the following hallowe   'en produced an underground rumbling queerly synchronised with bursts of flame  ''them witch whateleys' doin's '' from the summit of sentinel hill .
idle folk, indeed, said that kalos conversed with the spirits of the grove, and that his statues were but images of the fauns and dryads he met there for he patterned his work after no living model .
then he handed the instrument to morgan, whose sight was keener .
so i read again that hideous chapter, and shuddered doubly because it was indeed not new to me .
no longer could he share the peculiarities and prejudices of the martenses, while the very mountain thunderstorms failed to intoxicate him as they had before .
neither he nor his son archer knew of the shunned house as other than a nuisance almost impossible to rent perhaps on account of the mustiness and sickly odour of unkempt old age .
then men in olive drab came, bearing muskets; till it seemed as if in its sad sleep the street must have some haunting dreams of those other days, when musket bearing men in conical hats walked along it from the woodland spring to the cluster of houses by the beach .
both, though, agreed that they must leave this ancient and accursed house as soon as it could be arranged .
old bugs himself seemed also to belong to the past, for his nondescript clothing bore every hallmark of antiquity .
it is not reassuring to see, on a closer glance, that most of the houses are deserted and falling to ruin, and that the broken steepled church now harbours the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet .
had he signed the black man 's book after all?
there had been soft talking, too and as he began to describe it his voice had sunk to an inaudible whisper .
there were rumblings under the hills that night, and the whippoorwills piped threateningly .
all traces of strange dreaming had vanished with his recovery, and my uncle kept no record of his night thoughts after a week of pointless and irrelevant accounts of thoroughly usual visions .
in the small hours of that night he slept a little in an easy chair in his office, but was at the manuscript again before dawn .
he must ask frank elwood for help .
when the stars were right, they could plunge from world to world through the sky; but when the stars were wrong, they could not live .
the steps creaked, but seemed tolerably sound; and i raced down past a barn like second story to the ground floor .
below the waist, though, it was the worst; for here all human resemblance left off and sheer phantasy began .
actually, the horrified pause of the men was of comparatively brief duration .
some instinct warned armitage that what was taking place was not a thing for unfortified eyes to see, so he brushed back the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door .
he had, though, heard the french canadian who lodged just under gilman talking to mazurewicz one evening .
i saw from the beginning that he was both interested and sympathetic, and when i had finished he analysed and discussed the thing with the greatest shrewdness and judgment .
day after day and night after night did we sail, and when the moon was full we would listen to soft songs of the oarsmen, sweet as on that distant night when we sailed away from my far native land .
johansen 's voyage had begun just as he told it to the vice admiralty .
piles of moss covered stones near the water promised tolerable seats, and the scene was sheltered from all possible view by a ruined warehouse on the north .
          ''it's a goin' agin, an' this time by day it's aout it's aout an' a movin' this very minute, an' only the lord knows when it'll be on us all '' the speaker panted into silence, but another took up his message .
she certainly knew nothing about it .
it had already begun as soon as wilbur was born, when one of the many tool sheds had been put suddenly in order, clapboarded, and fitted with a stout fresh lock .
all were afoot save libo, balbutius, asellius, two or three of the centuriones, and myself, and at length the way became so steep and narrow that those who had horses were forced to leave them; a squad of ten men being left to guard them, though robber bands were not likely to be abroad on such a night of terror .
i was by this time thankfully certain that the railway itself was not patrolled .
awed, shaken, and portentous, my friend who had been beyond the barrier warned me that we must never venture within those realms again .
the box held only a queer parchment whose characters no linguist or palaeographer has been able to decipher or identify .

     ''an' then she let aout a turrible yell, an' says the shed daown the rud had jest caved in like the storm hed blowed it over, only the wind wa'n't strong enough to dew that .
but then the blow fell .
the few callers at the house would often find lavinia alone on the ground floor, while odd cries and footsteps resounded in the boarded up second story .
his mania shewed itself only in his tight boarding up of all the windows in the reclaimed section though many declared that it was a crazy thing to bother with the reclamation at all .
in a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of perhaps an acre 's extent, clear of trees and tolerably dry .
he dropped them all years ago, and no one feels sure whether he left the country or merely sank from sight in some hidden byway .
many covered their eyes with their hands, and plunged blindly and awkwardly in their race to escape; overturning furniture and stumbling against the walls before they managed to reach one of the many doors .
later the god and the princess had returned, and upon the death of the princess her divine husband had mummified the body and enshrined it in a vast house of stone, where it was worshipped .
for several days they glided undulatingly over the water, till finally they came to the horizon, where the sea meets the sky .
as a result, these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent .
very nervously he watched that narrow oaken gate in the high and ivy clad stone wall .
friends and companions he shuns, for he wishes to answer no questions .
many times i walked through that valley, and longer and longer would i pause in the spectral half light where the giant trees squirmed and twisted grotesquely, and the grey ground stretched damply from trunk to trunk, sometimes disclosing the mould stained stones of buried temples .
we shall meet again perhaps in the shining mists of orion 's sword, perhaps on a bleak plateau in prehistoric asia .
at one time johnson recited to me some lines by a servant to the duke of leeds, which had so amus 'd him, that he had got them by heart .
of the six men who never reached the ship, he thinks two perished of pure fright in that accursed instant .
as i approached the arch i began to perceive the presence more clearly; and then, with the first and last sound i ever uttered a ghastly ululation that revolted me almost as poignantly as its noxious cause i beheld in full, frightful vividness the inconceivable, indescribable, and unmentionable monstrosity which had by its simple appearance changed a merry company to a herd of delirious fugitives .
the man was great i say it even now, knowing as much as i do .
our alarm was now divided, for besides our fear of the unknown, we had always entertained a dread that our grisly collection might be discovered .
the figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close and careful study, was between seven and eight inches in height, and of exquisitely artistic workmanship .
it was, the professor stated, a very crude bas relief of stone, comprising a hideous picture and some cryptic writing .
for centuries its lofty battlements have frowned down upon the wild and rugged countryside about, serving as a home and stronghold for the proud house whose honoured line is older even than the moss grown castle walls .
then a faint clicking came from the instrument, and i called down to my friend in a tense voice .
but still i read more in hidden, forgotten books and scrolls to which my new vision led me and pushed through fresh gateways of space and being and life patterns toward the core of the unknown cosmos .
i told him that i could, and translated for his benefit a paragraph near the beginning .
go thou then to athok the cobbler or be gone out of the city by sunset .
it is the land of hope, and in it shine the perfect ideals of all that we know elsewhere; or at least so men relate .
i will repeat here what he said, underlining the words he emphasised:  ''he is calling he is calling i hear him we must go '' as he spoke he took his ivory image from the table, pocketed it, and seized my arm in an effort to drag me up the companionway to the deck .
the final conclusion of the linguists was that the text represented an artificial alphabet, giving the effect of a cipher; though none of the usual methods of cryptographic solution seemed to furnish any clue, even when applied on the basis of every tongue the writer might conceivably have used .
we got all kinds here reel life an ' a good time .
my room, a dismal rear one with two windows and bare, cheap furnishings, overlooked a dingy courtyard otherwise hemmed in by low, deserted brick blocks, and commanded a view of decrepit westward stretching roofs with a marshy countryside beyond .
i scraped further, and saw that it had form .
divorced from the enlightenment of civilisation, the strength of these puritans turned into singular channels; and in their isolation, morbid self repression, and struggle for life with relentless nature, there came to them dark furtive traits from the prehistoric depths of their cold northern heritage .
my friend said they were horrible and impressive beyond my most fevered imaginings; that what was thrown on a screen in the darkened room prophesied things none but nyarlathotep dared prophesy, and that in the sputter of his sparks there was taken from men that which had never been taken before yet which shewed only in the eyes .
as it was, lacking their original letters, i half suspected the compiler of having asked leading questions, or of having edited the correspondence in corroboration of what he had latently resolved to see .
at length, after temporarily felling one of his detainers with a sudden blow, he had flung himself upon the other in a daemoniac ecstasy of bloodthirstiness, shrieking fiendishly that he would   'jump high in the air and burn his way through anything that stopped him' .
behind the figure was a vague suggestion of a cyclopean architectural background .
that these secrets should be brought to light seemed injudicious, and i began to wish for an excuse to leave the castle and the village .
i  've seen wilbur whateley's diary and read some of the strange old books he used to read; and i think i know the right kind of spell to recite to make the thing fade away .

only his lividly inclined complexion and coldness of touch could have afforded a physical basis for this feeling, and even these things should have been excusable considering the man 's known invalidism .
the skin was thickly covered with coarse black fur, and from the abdomen a score of long greenish grey tentacles with red sucking mouths protruded limply .
around that head it closed, totally swallowing it up, and in another moment it had begun to recede; bearing away its invisible burden without touching me, and flowing again out of that black doorway and down the unseen stairs, which creaked as before, though in reverse order .
i felt subtly that the apartment of this ancient victim was best for my purposes .
finally the connecting door gave, but with such a crash that i knew those outside must have heard .
shortly afterward the pale faced workmen apprised the superintendent of their failure .
there was the immemorial figure of the deputy or messenger of hidden and terrible powers the  ''black man '' of the witch cult, and the  ''nyarlathotep '' of the necronomicon .
outside, the moon played on the ridgepole of the block below, and i saw that the jump would be desperately hazardous because of the steep surface on which i must land .
heaven be thanked for the instinct which led me unconscious to places where men dwell; to the peaceful village that slept under the calm stars of clearing skies .
the pequots, enfeebled by a previous war, could give the now stricken narragansetts no assistance; and in a dutch fur trader of albany, petrus van schaack, secured the distinguished cranium for the modest sum of two guilders, he having recognised its value from the half effaced inscription carved in lombardic minuscules palaeography, it might be explained, was one of the leading accomplishments of new netherland fur traders of the seventeenth century .
all was as of old, nor were the marble walls discoloured, nor the polished bronze statues upon them tarnished .
ye see, they was able to live both in an  ' aout o' water what they call amphibians, i guess .
how could he keep himself from going?
for them are the catacombs of ptolemais, and the carven mausolea of the nightmare countries .
he clearly understood my needs at a glance, and ministered to them with a master 's deftness; the while reassuring me in a finely modulated though oddly hollow and timbreless voice that he was the bitterest of sworn enemies to death, and had sunk his fortune and lost all his friends in a lifetime of bizarre experiment devoted to its bafflement and extirpation .
it might be actively hostile, or it might be dictated merely by blind motives of self preservation .
throughout that afternoon they rode around dunwich; questioning the natives concerning all that had occurred, and seeing for themselves with rising pangs of horror the drear frye ruins with their lingering traces of the tarry stickiness, the blasphemous tracks in the frye yard, the wounded seth bishop cattle, and the enormous swaths of disturbed vegetation in various places .
then donovan felt over it delicately around the edge, pressing each point separately as he went .
on the far, misty horizon i could just make out the dizzy profile of the head, topped by the queer ancient house of which so many legends are told; but for the moment all my attention was captured by the nearer panorama just below me .
lying on its side for it could not stand up alone was the exotic spiky figure which in his monstrous dream he had broken off the fantastic balustrade .
he had grown as large as a child of four, and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker .
it seemed, in any event, to be contagious; for hannah bowen, one of the two servants, died of it in the following june .
then we reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond, where the manuxet joins the sea just north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in kingsport head and veer off toward cape ann .
it  's all the same now, for he's gone back into the fabulous darkness he loved to haunt .
if it had only snarled, or bayed, or laughed titteringly even that would have relieved the abysmal hideousness .
he had shewn little regret when shut into the barred room at huntingdon, for his mind moved curiously .
at that moment, as i say, i was elated with the conviction that the one great goal had been attained; and that for the first time a reanimated corpse had uttered distinct words impelled by actual reason .
in auckland i learned that johansen had returned with yellow hair turned white after a perfunctory and inconclusive questioning at sydney, and had thereafter sold his cottage in west street and sailed with his wife to his old home in oslo .
finally i hired a seedy looking loafer whom i encountered on the corner of eighth avenue to keep the patient supplied with ice from a little shop where i introduced him, and applied myself diligently to the task of finding a pump piston and engaging workmen competent to install it .
then the glass broke shiveringly under the persistent impacts, and the chill wind rushed in, making the candles sputter and rustling the sheets of paper on the table where zann had begun to write out his horrible secret .
i was almost paralysed, but not too much so to make a feeble effort toward flight; a backward stumble which failed to break the spell in which the nameless, voiceless monster held me .
and pickman had it as no man ever had it before or i hope to heaven ever will again .
what would the storm call forth or was there anything left for it to call?
among the animals in the exhibition with which he travelled was a huge bull gorilla of lighter colour than the average; a surprisingly tractable beast of much popularity with the performers .
his name was barzai the wise, and the villagers tell of how he went up a mountain on the night of the strange eclipse .
my stricken friend moved them to no pity, but what they found on the couch in the studio made them give me a praise which sickened me, and now a fame which i spurn in despair as i sit for hours, bald, grey bearded, shrivelled, palsied, drug crazed, and broken, adoring and praying to the object they found .
half unconscious, i opened the grating and staggered out upon the white gravel path that stretched away in two directions .
what do moderns know of life and the forces behind it?
the clergymen or priests, or whatever they were called nowadays also wore this kind of ornament as a head dress; but one seldom caught glimpses of them .
and some were strangely robed    . . .
       ''git aout o' here git aout o' here they seen us git aout fer your life dun't wait fer nothin' they know naow run fer it quick aout o' this taown  '' another heavy wave dashed against the loosening masonry of the bygone wharf, and changed the mad ancient's whisper to another inhuman and blood curdling scream .
shortly afterward i was taken through those antique ways so dear to my fancy narrow, curving alleys and passages where rows of red georgian brick blinked with small paned dormers above pillared doorways that had looked on gilded sedans and panelled coaches and in the first flush of realisation of these long wished things i thought i had indeed achieved such treasures as would make me in time a poet .
then i thought with renewed force of what the factory inspector had heard in the night in this mouldering and pestilential building .
he worked largely by feeling now, since newly gathered clouds hid the moon; and though progress was still slow, he felt heartened at the extent of his encroachments on the top and bottom of the aperture .
all at once the head turned sharply in my direction and the eyes fell open, causing me to stare in blank amazement at what i beheld .
the immediate problem was how to reach the ancient railway; and i now saw that the safest course was ahead to babson street, then west to lafayette there edging around but not crossing an open space homologous to the one i had traversed and subsequently back northward and westward in a zigzagging line through lafayette, bates, adams, and bank streets the latter skirting the river gorge to the abandoned and dilapidated station i had seen from my window .
nevertheless there is an ancient house on that cliff, and at evening men see lights in the small paned windows .
for a long hour the watchers gazed, whilst the vapours swirled and the screen of clouds grew thicker and more restless .
the natives, all of whom had talked with the policemen, seemed at first as perplexed as armitage and his companions .
my informant had noticed it many times, and had heard it spoken of as coming from some secret hoard, either of pirates or of daemons .
his interest gradually veered away from the unplumbed voids beyond the slanting surfaces, since it now appeared that the purpose of those surfaces concerned the side he was already on .
the column seemed very thin indeed as it plodded dreamily into the gulf .
the small paned windows were largely broken, and a nameless air of desolation hung round the precarious panelling, shaky interior shutters, peeling wall paper, falling plaster, rickety staircases, and such fragments of battered furniture as still remained .
i repeat to you, gentlemen, that your inquisition is fruitless .
then he commenced whispering as in awe:  ''el ritmo, señor el ritmo de la tierra that throb down in the ground '' and now i also heard; heard and shivered and without knowing why .
for now, when the wind sweeps boisterous out of the north past the high ancient house that is one with the firmament, there is broken at last that ominous brooding silence ever before the bane of kingsport 's maritime cotters .
cap  'n ebenezer holt traded me thet in 'sixty eight him as was kilt in the war . ''
in time he grew so impatient of the bleak intervals of day that he began buying drugs in order to increase his periods of sleep .
noiseless infinity eddied around the dreamer and wafted him away without even touching the body that leaned stiffly from the lonely window; and for days not counted in men 's calendars the tides of far spheres bare him gently to join the dreams for which he longed; the dreams that men have lost .
each transmitted idea formed rapidly in my mind, and though no actual language was employed, my habitual association of conception and expression was so great that i seemed to be receiving the message in ordinary english .
this morning the strange pulls from space seemed lessened, though they were replaced by another sensation even more inexplicable .
then, from the farthermost regions of remoteness, the sound softly glided into existence .
an ' gawd in heaven that haff face on top   . .
it was not long before i found that zann 's eagerness for my company was not as great as it had seemed while he was persuading me to move down from the fifth story .
and the king bade him put away his tattered purple, and clothed him in satin and cloth of gold, with rings of green jade and bracelets of tinted ivory, and lodged him in a gilded and tapestried chamber on a bed of sweet carven wood with canopies and coverlets of flower embroidered silk .
the professors at miskatonic had urged him to slacken up, and had voluntarily cut down his course at several points .
the young gentleman had better be sure to wear the crucifix joe mazurewicz had given him .
amidst this elysian realm i dwelt not as a stranger, for each sight and sound was familiar to me; just as it had been for uncounted aeons of eternity before, and would be for like eternities to come .
that is why i continued to feel that wilcox, somehow cognisant of the old data which my uncle had possessed, had been imposing on the veteran scientist .
 ''used to be talk of a queer foreign kind of jewellery that the sailors and refinery men sometimes sold on the sly, or that was seen once or twice on some of the marsh womenfolks .
then the doctor came with his medicine case and asked crisp questions, and removed the patient 's outer clothing, shoes, and socks .
the marshy region began very shortly, with the single track on a low, grassy embankment where the weedy growth was somewhat thinner .
saturday the th i spent in total darkness, tormented by thoughts and memories that threatened to overcome my german will .
i was sorry when i saw that there would be no other passengers on the bus .
at the end of the cut it would cross the track and swerve off to a safer distance; but meanwhile i must be exceedingly careful .
i thought, too, of those nameless swimmers i had seen .
toward the middle of the next night he drowsed off in his chair, but soon woke out of a tangle of nightmares almost as hideous as the truths and menaces to man 's existence that he had uncovered .
i screamed aloud that i was not afraid; that i never could be afraid; and others screamed with me for solace .
and when they were come into the town they found rose wreathed revellers bound from house to house and leaning from windows and balconies, who listened to the songs of iranon and tossed him flowers and applauded when he was done .
a sandy tongue had formed inside this barrier, and upon it i saw a few decrepit cabins, moored dories, and scattered lobster pots .
the vault to which i refer is of ancient granite, weathered and discoloured by the mists and dampness of generations .
from such books i learned all that i know .
now he seemed to sense the close presence of some terrible part of the intruding horror, and to glimpse a hellish advance in the black dominion of the ancient and once passive nightmare .
it was their changeling and in a spirit of supreme irony pickman had given the features a very perceptible resemblance to his own .
two biological points he was exceedingly anxious to settle first, whether any amount of consciousness and rational action be possible without the brain, proceeding from the spinal cord and various nerve centres; and second, whether any kind of ethereal, intangible relation distinct from the material cells may exist to link the surgically separated parts of what has previously been a single living organism .
in the end the three men from arkham old, white bearded dr   . armitage, stocky, iron grey professor rice, and lean, youngish dr. morgan ascended the mountain alone.
the officials devised excuses not to enter the noisome boarded place; and were glad to confine their survey of the deceased 's living quarters, the newly mended sheds, to a single visit .
everything was wrong, with the broad window shewing a sea of roofs in which only about one in five was ancient, and the sound of trolleys and motors in the streets below .
when we did turn, it was to climb through the deserted length of the oldest and dirtiest alley i ever saw in my life, with crumbling looking gables, broken small paned windows, and archaic chimneys that stood out half disintegrated against the moonlit sky .
scenes were blocked out with extreme care, and pencilled guide lines told of the minute exactitude which pickman used in getting the right perspective and proportions .
the remaining two had gone back wordlessly to their mountains and this autumn not a single villager had disappeared .
but still there remained that burning determination to reach the innermost secret of the fear, which i had once more come to deem definite, material, and organic .
 ''can you dare you go far? ''
louis, son to robert, was found drowned in the moat at the same fateful age, and thus down through the centuries ran the ominous chronicle; henris, roberts, antoines, and armands snatched from happy and virtuous lives when little below the age of their unfortunate ancestor at his murder .
out of that crash came darkness, and i heard the shrieking of men and of things which were not men .
several times he had actually obtained signs of life in animals supposedly dead; in many cases violent signs; but he soon saw that the perfection of this process, if indeed possible, would necessarily involve a lifetime of research .
his condition was more ghastly .
the eyes approached, yet of the thing that bore them i could distinguish only a claw .
i cannot even hint what it was like, for it was a compound of all that is unclean, uncanny, unwelcome, abnormal, and detestable .
they had talked about dying and half deserted innsmouth for nearly a century, and nothing new could be wilder or more hideous than what they had whispered and hinted years before .
at length i reached the lower hall, at one end of which i saw a faint luminous rectangle marking the ruined paine street doorway .
at the hospital they told me i had been found half frozen in kingsport harbour at dawn, clinging to the drifting spar that accident sent to save me .
at the college we used an incinerator, but the apparatus was too costly for our unauthorised laboratory .
trembling with a terror oddly mixed with ecstasy i crossed the circular room to the north window from which i could see the village and the plain at the edge of the bog .
in the evening they drowsily discussed the mathematical studies which had so completely and perhaps harmfully engrossed gilman, and speculated about the linkage with ancient magic and folklore which seemed so darkly probable .
blue, green, grey, white, or black; smooth, ruffled, or mountainous; that ocean is not silent .
the latter, he had said, was the daughter of a portuguese trader whom he had met in africa; and did not like english ways .
now he felt that he must go north infinitely north .
i had never, seemingly, heard human speech before; and could guess only vaguely what was said .
west and i had met in college, and i had been the only one to sympathise with his hideous experiments .
many would have disliked to live if possessed of the peculiar features of arthur jermyn, but he had been a poet and scholar and had not minded .
and the day wore on, and still olney listened to rumours of old times and far places, and heard how the kings of atlantis fought with the slippery blasphemies that wriggled out of rifts in ocean 's floor, and how the pillared and weedy temple of poseidonis is still glimpsed at midnight by lost ships, who know by its sight that they are lost .
but it cast a shadow of myself and the cot on the floor, and had a yellowish, penetrating force that hinted at things more potent than luminosity .
i had been on a long visit to my parents in illinois, and upon my return found west in a state of singular elation .
when i finally found myself adrift and free, i had but little idea of my surroundings .
there had been a strange kidnapping the night before in orne 's gangway, and the two year old child of a clod like laundry worker named anastasia wolejko had completely vanished from sight .
the vault had been dug from a hillside, so that the narrow ventilation funnel in the top ran through several feet of earth, making this direction utterly useless to consider .
gradually i came to wonder what might be my place in that city on the strange plateau betwixt strange peaks .
i knew we must have passed down through the mountain and beneath the earth of kingsport itself, and i shivered that a town should be so aged and maggoty with subterraneous evil .
for a second nobody dared to turn on the light, then armitage summoned up his courage and snapped the switch .
in either case it would have been appropriate; for the unexpected tenacity of the easy looking brickwork was surely a sardonic commentary on the vanity of mortal hopes, and the source of a task whose performance deserved every possible stimulus .
then thought trickled back, and i knew that i had witnessed things more horrible than i had dreamed .
but repugnance was soon forgotten in admiration, for the strange physician 's extreme skill at once became manifest despite the ice coldness and shakiness of his bloodless looking hands .
this worry had probably been a major cause of his mother 's death two years before .
beyond the worlds vague ghosts of monstrous things; half seen columns of unsanctified temples that rest on nameless rocks beneath space and reach up to dizzy vacua above the spheres of light and darkness .
and the children would listen, and learn of the laws and deeds of old, and of that dear england which they had never seen, or could not remember .
on spring evenings it would be low in the northeast .
they had not seen it, but had heard such cries from one of their hamlets that they knew a creeping death had come .
i was between my two companions, george bennett being toward the window and william tobey toward the fireplace .
the street lights we first encountered had been of oil, and of the ancient lozenge pattern .
and so they went up wildly over rocks and gulfs, slipping and stumbling, and sometimes awed at the vastness and horrible silence of bleak ice pinnacles and mute granite steeps .
may i say that he flouted the sanctity of things as great as space and time, and that he put to strange uses the rites of sartain half breed red indians once encamped upon this hill?
the sorry planet shell being well nigh spent, in less than an hour my fellow would be free to pursue the oppressor along the milky way and past the hither stars to the very confines of infinity .
   ''but the real thing behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudice and i don't say i'm blaming those that hold it .
i was now shaking with a deadly fear, and the bearded man almost had to hold me up as he walked me across the room to the mirror, the faint lamp i   .e., that formerly on the table, not the still fainter lantern he had brought in his free hand.
in appearance all were marked by a peculiar inherited dissimilarity of eyes; one generally being blue and the other brown .
accordingly i continued my experiments, though informing no one of their nature .
the strange stone house on the woodland slope was to me only a source of interest and speculation; and its cold, damp interior, into which i vainly peered through the aperture so tantalisingly left, contained for me no hint of death or decay .
but not many flags floated over the street, for therein brooded only fear and hatred and ignorance .
by the fourth evening i attained the base of the mound, which turned out to be much higher than it had appeared from a distance; an intervening valley setting it out in sharper relief from the general surface .
there was something there and now i can 't use the subway or and you may as well have your laugh at this, too go down into cellars any more .
  ''nor is it to be thought, '' ran the text as armitage mentally translated it,  ''that man is either the oldest or the last of earth's masters, or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone .
so a body of twenty police, filling two carriages and an automobile, had set out in the late afternoon with the shivering squatter as a guide .
i was by this time his active and enthralled assistant, and helped him make all his decisions, not only concerning the source of bodies but concerning a suitable place for our loathsome work .
the more he withdrew from the world about him, the more wonderful became his dreams; and it would have been quite futile to try to describe them on paper .
the dark blocks of granite, the door so curiously ajar, and the funereal carvings above the arch, aroused in me no associations of mournful or terrible character .
i was up ta his haouse onct, on the hill, tradin ' hosses, when i see this book .
the government men never found poor zadok, and have no conjectures to make as to what became of him .
then, in spite of my daze of fright and disgust, my morbid curiosity triumphed; and as the last of the monstrosities oozed up alone from that nether world of unknown nightmare, i drew my automatic pistol and shot it under cover of the thunder .
so liberal, indeed, was the discipline of our captors, that five days after we were taken i managed to escape alone in a small boat with water and provisions for a good length of time .
she seemed to crystallise at a point closer to the ceiling than to the floor, and every night she was a little nearer and more distinct before the dream shifted .
several faces i recognised; though i should have known them better had they been shrivelled or eaten away by death and decomposition .
toward the end of march he began to pick up in his mathematics, though other studies bothered him increasingly .
it was the shrieking fulfilment of all the horror which that corpse city had ever stirred in my soul, and forgetting every injunction to silence i screamed and screamed and screamed as my nerves gave way and the walls quivered about me .
they are grown stern, and where once they suffered men to displace them, they now forbid men to come, or coming, to depart .
this is the last rational act i ever performed .
inside the hall were music, laughter, and wine on every hand .
i had been living in many poor places, always evicted for want of money; until at last i came upon that tottering house in the rue d 'auseil, kept by the paralytic blandot .
as he copied the formula he finally chose, dr  . armitage looked involuntarily over his shoulder at the open pages; the left hand one of which, in the latin version, contained such monstrous threats to the peace and sanity of the world.
upon landing in salem zerubbabel set it up in his cupboard beside the chimney, he having built a modest house near the town pump .
sawyer, as clumsy as most non users of optical devices are, fumbled a while; but eventually focussed the lenses with armitage 's aid .
in my mind i would often picture the unknown land of cathuria with its splendid groves and palaces, and would wonder what new delights there awaited me .
 ''some chicken '' leered a drunken man as he viewed the beautiful face, but those who were sober did not leer, looking with respect and abashment at the delicate and spiritual features .
next there came to me the impression of light amidst the darkness of dead batteries, and i seemed to see a sort of phosphorescent glow in the water through the porthole which opened toward the temple .
